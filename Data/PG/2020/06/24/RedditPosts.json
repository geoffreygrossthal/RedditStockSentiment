        "content": "Hi everyone. I made this google spreadsheet, which allows you to track basic stock information automatically, all you need to do is enter the ticker and the remaining cells will be filled up. In order to use the spreadsheet, you'll need to make a copy of it.\n\nThe spreadsheet tracks: Current price, Sector, Company Name, Annual Dividend, Dividend Yield, EPS, PE Ratio, RSI, 1 year estimate and analysts recommendation (1=buy and 5=sell).\n\nI hope this can help everyone here.\n\nI am working on another spreadsheet which will calculate some of the above and also: Gain/Loss, Growth, Annual Income, Cost Basis, Market value and more, this one will also have graphs and charts.\n\nAnyways, here is the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q5WHOliGkq59yoXRvjbiv36bUPLTSRxJ6quaJXDgKUw/edit?usp=sharing). If you want to add more stocks just select the rows and drag them down.\n\nThanks for reading and I hope it can be helpful. Stay safe\n\nPD: The information may have some delay (20 min max)\n\nEdit: The sheet has been updated. It now works with ticker with \".\" like BRK.B\n\nEdit2: After you input your tickers some may say not found, wait a little as it can be loading.\n\nEdit3: Once you have your own copy, close the main document to reduce traffic, as it may cause issues for other people.",
