        "content": " New York (CNN Business)Tesla is preparing to [split its stock](http://www.cnn.com/2020/08/11/cars/tesla-stock-split/index.html), making it more affordable for average investors. It may need to do another one pretty soon if its shares keep surging.Tesla ([TSLA](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=TSLA&source=story_quote_link)) has skyrocketed 50% since announcing the stock split on August 11. It now trades at nearly $2,100 a share.Once [the split](http://www.cnn.com/2020/08/18/investing/stock-splits-apple-tesla/index.html) goes into effect on August 31, current Tesla investors will get five shares for each one they own. That will [cut the price](http://www.cnn.com/2020/08/11/cars/tesla-stock-split/index.html) by a fifth, to almost $420 a share. The market value of Tesla, now hovering around $390 billion, will remain the same.But does Tesla deserve to trade at such a high valuation? While the [Elon Musk-led company](http://www.cnn.com/2020/08/18/success/elon-musk-tesla-ipo-vault-interview/index.html) is generating [consistent profits](http://www.cnn.com/2020/07/22/cars/tesla-earnings-q2/index.html), its sales are dwarfed by the major auto giants.Tesla is expected to generate nearly $30 billion in annual revenue this year. That’s nothing to sneeze at. But Fiat Chrysler ([FCAU](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=FCAU&source=story_quote_link)) is estimated to report $100 billion in sales for 2020. GM ([GM](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=GM&source=story_quote_link)) and Ford ([F](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=F&source=story_quote_link)) are each forecast to post annual revenue of more than $110 billion.Still, Tesla’s market value is now more than four times the combined market caps of Detroit’s Big 3.\n\nA majority of Wall Street analysts are betting against Tesla. Of the 33 that officially track the stock, only eight have a buy rating on Tesla while 15 have it rated a hold and 10 are recommending a sell on it.Only three of the Tesla analysts currently have a price target for it above $2,000. The consensus target is just under $1,300 — almost 40% below its current price.Tesla continues to be a [big target of short sellers](http://www.cnn.com/2020/01/30/investing/short-selling-squeeze/index.html), investors who borrow the stock and sell it with the hopes of eventually buying it back at a lower price.Of course, Tesla fans can correctly point out that analysts have been consistently wrong and that Wall Street will eventually have to raise its earnings forecasts and price targets on the stock.Tesla may also get a further boost if it is [finally added](http://www.cnn.com/2020/02/06/investing/tesla-sp-500/index.html) to the blue-chip [S&P 500 index](https://money.cnn.com/data/markets/sandp/) — a move that could soon happen now that the company has posted a consistent run of profitable quarters.\n\nFull Article:  [http://pioret.com/tesla-has-soared-50-since-announcing-its-stock-split-last-week](http://pioret.com/tesla-has-soared-50-since-announcing-its-stock-split-last-week)",
