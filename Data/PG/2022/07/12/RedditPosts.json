        "content": "Everywhere is reporting that Musk now has a \"massive windfall that dwarfs any bitcoin losses\" due to the sale of the TSLA stock to fund the TWTR deal, and as that deal is no longer going ahead, he's pockets the cash.\n\nI'm then reminded that some shrewd analysts suggested that the divorces of Bezos and Gates to their wives were actually cover to sell massive amounts of stocks without causing a run on their companies (Founders selling huge chunks of stock usually causes investors to shit it but can be explained away for personal reasons).\n\nI'm starting to think that Elon knows he's got a tough road ahead, the golden days of Tesla stock price are behind him and he's just liquidated massive amounts of stock at what will seem like a really high price in 10 years from now as all the big car manufacturers finally catch up and dilute Tesla's only real advantage (being first).\n\nEDIT: wow, RIP my inbox and thanks for all the comments. \n\nOne comment in particular really seems to confirm the above suspicion:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/RealTesla/comments/uelztn/elon_musk_will_be_most_indebted_ceo_in_america_if/i6pobqe?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3",
