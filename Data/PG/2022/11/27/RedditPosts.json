        "content": "Using [EV-CPO.com](https://EV-CPO.com), I've been tracking used Model 3 pricing primarily for my own research. I have parameters set for Clean title, under $45k, and under 30k miles. A month ago, a couple would pop up and get snagged very quickly. Since 11/8, average pricing has come down around 6%, but the amount of inventory has been doubling each week. 70 @ 11/17, 150 @ 11/22, 288 @ 11/27. It appears inventory is getting released but cars are just sitting likely because a base 2023 M3 (edit: Tesla Model 3) is $46k with only a couple week lead time. But whether it's Elon's antics tarnishing the brand, high interest rates, or hesitancy in spending, it seems like it's having an effect for sure.",
