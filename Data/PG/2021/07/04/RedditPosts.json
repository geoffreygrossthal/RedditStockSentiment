        "content": "What are some of your favorite long term \"set it and forget it\" plays? I am currently 23 years old and will obviously sit on and contribute to my Roth IRA until I retire. Any suggestions?\n\nMy current portfolio includes things like:\n\n$VTI (Most of my portfolio)\n$BRKB\n$MSFT\n$V\n$AAPL\n$VXUS\n$FTNT\n\nEdit: Obviously I will have to sell at some point. Interested to hear about both stocks and funds.\n\nEdit #2: Wow this blew up! Thank you all for the suggestions. We are nearing 700 comments so there is no chance I will get through all of them but I did get through a lot in the beginning. I'm happy to see other people on this sub focusing on long term investing.\n\nEdit #3: Can someone find a way to analyze the comments on this thread and figure out what the most mentioned stocks are? I would love to see the results.",
