        "content": "The consumer price index was expected to rise 6.7% from a year ago in November, according to economists surveyed by Dow Jones.\n\nThe consumer price index, which measures the cost of a wide-ranging basket of goods, rose 0.8% for the month, good for a 6.8% pace on a year over year basis and the fastest rate since June 1982.\n\nExcluding food and energy prices, so-called core CPI was up 0.5% for the month and 4.9% from a year ago, which itself was the sharpest pickup since mid-1991.\n\nThe Dow Jones estimate was for a 6.7% annual gain for headline CPI and 4.9% for core.\n\nWith unemployment claims running at their lowest pace since 1969 and gross domestic product expected to show strong gains to end 2021 after a lackluster third quarter, inflation remains the biggest problem for the recovery.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is watching the data closely ahead of its two-day meeting next week.\n\nCentral bank officials have indicated that will begin slowing the help theyâ€™re providing in an effort to tamp down inflation. Investors widely expect the Fed to double the tapering of its asset purchases to $30 billion a month, likely starting in January. That would enable the Fed to start raising interest rates as soon as next spring.\n\n[Link to the CNBC article, written by Jeff Cox](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/10/consumer-price-index-november-2021.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.CopyToPasteboard)",
