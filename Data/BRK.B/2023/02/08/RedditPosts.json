        "content": " Google’s new AI-powered chatbot Bard has stumbled at the first hurdle after it gave a misleading response during a demonstration at a launch event this week.\n\nThe AI search assistant, unveiled on Tuesday, is used by Google to generate text summaries of search results.\n\nYet in an animated image of Google Bard in action distributed by Google to mark the new feature’s launch, it gives a wrong answer.\n\nThe falsehood will raise further questions about the accuracy of search engines and of AI-generated answers to humans’ questions.\n\nIn an animated GIF showing how Bard works, a user types in the search query \"what new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9 year old about?\"\n\nThe NASA telescope was made operational in December 2021 and has been used by scientists to make several discoveries of new planets outside the Solar System.\n\nOne of the responses generated by Bard says: \"JWST took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system.\"\n\nYet this is not accurate. The first picture ever taken of a planet outside the solar system - an exoplanet - was captured in 2004 by the Very Large Telescope array in Chile.\n\n[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2023/02/08/googles-bard-ai-chatbot-gives-wrong-answer-launch-event/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2023/02/08/googles-bard-ai-chatbot-gives-wrong-answer-launch-event/)",
