        "content": "I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.\n\n**How is \"Hype\" calculated?**\n\nWell, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit\n\n**How can I use this list?**\n\nThe best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.\n\n# Most Hyped Stock Threads\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Title|Tickers|Avg Hype %|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|[GME shorts get crushed as explained by Cramer ... big WSB shout out, the first of two in the show tonight](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxhitu/gme_shorts_get_crushed_as_explained_by_cramer_big/)|GME|300+%|\n|[Tesla passes Facebook to become fifth most valuable U.S. company](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kt4dsy/tesla_passes_facebook_to_become_fifth_most/)|FB, TSLA|300+%|\n|[Citi wants a war?
