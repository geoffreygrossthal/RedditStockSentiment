They could have incentivized their drivers to put sensors on their cars and collect data much faster than even $TSLA.\"\n\nThe tweet was in response to a question about Ark Invest's portfolio.\n\nData collection and AI are closely intertwined because machine learning systems develop faster and with greater precision when they are paired with large data sets.\n\nWhy It Matters: Wood's opinion carries weight. She has become the breakout star of the 2020 bull market as her actively-managed ETFs generate phenomenal returns. Shares of her ARK Innovation ETF ARKK, -1.43% are up over 163% this year.\n\nARK has predicted Tesla shares will hit $7,000 in 2024. Tesla is the top holding in the Ark Innovation ETF, at 9.98% of assets.",
