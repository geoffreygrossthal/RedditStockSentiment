If they suddenly bought as much stock as they could, in this environment, how much movement do you think we would see? Would this drive a bullish sentiment in stocks enough across the board to see significant changes? If so, couldn't Buffet essentially start his own stock market surge at any moment by choosing to do this? Not to say this is true of any mega cap company, but specifically for buffett since he is both one of the wealthiest in the world, and is possibly the most sought after voice in the investing world",

        "content": "Alphabet-owned Waymo is removing the waitlist for its self-driving service in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet.\n\nStarting Tuesday, anyone in LA will be able to use the Waymo One app to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County, the company said. That includes the 300,000 Angelenos who have been on Waymo’s waitlist.\n\nWith more than 3.8 million people, LA marks the third and largest city where the company’s robotaxi service is now fully available. It follows San Francisco, where Waymo One opened citywide in June. The company opened the service in Phoenix in 2020.\n\n“Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,” Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo, said in a news release Tuesday. “Our service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We’re so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can’t wait to serve more riders soon.”\n\nThe company has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.\n\nWaymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture is owned by Google parent Alphabet, which led the series C investment in Waymo, alongside earlier backers including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.\n\nThe robotaxi company now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week across its three markets via the Waymo One app, the company said Tuesday. That’s up from 100,000 in August.\n\nWaymo in September announced that it partnered with Uber to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in 2025. The next-generation robotaxi from Waymo is a Geely Zeekr that’s equipped with custom sensors and an AI “driver.” Waymo also recently agreed to a multiyear strategic partnership with Hyundai that will add the South Korean automaker’s Ioniq 5 electric vehicle to its robotaxi fleet.\n\nThe Waymo One service has been embraced by some women who have safety concerns about riding with unknown human drivers. It has also been used by parents to send their teens to school.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/12/waymo-opens-robotaxi-service-to-anyone-in-los-angeles.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/12/waymo-opens-robotaxi-service-to-anyone-in-los-angeles.html)",

        "content": "Netflix’s cheaper, ad-supported tier has reached 70 million global monthly active users two years after it was launched.\n\nThe company said Tuesday that more than 50% of its new sign-ups are for ad-supported plans in countries that offer the option. Netflix said it continues “to see positive momentum and growth across all areas of the business,” adding it has seen “steady progress across all countries’ member bases.”\n\nNetflix launched the option in November 2022 as one of its responses to a slowdown in subscriber growth.\n\nRecently, subscriber growth hasn’t been an issue. Last month Netflix reported it added 5.1 million subscribers during the third quarter, beating Wall Street estimates. In total, Netflix counts 282.7 million memberships across all of its pricing tiers.\n\nBeginning next year, Netflix said it will no longer update investors on its subscriber numbers as it shifts focus toward revenue and other financial metrics as performance indicators.\n\nWhen Netflix launched its ad platform two years ago, the company said Nielsen would rate its content.\n\nNetflix in May announced it would air two National Football League games on Christmas Day this year as part of a three-year deal. On Tuesday it said it sold out of its ad inventory for the two live games.\n\nNetflix also said it’s brought on FanDuel and Verizon as advertisers for the games. FanDuel will become the exclusive pregame sportsbook betting partner, Netflix said, and will have a sponsored in-show feature.\n\nMedia companies have been focusing on ad-supported strategies for their streaming options that woo customers with cheaper plans and also offer advertising revenue that can help move the streaming businesses toward profitability. While the ad market has been slow for traditional TV, it has grown for streaming and digital businesses.\n\nNetflix offered its last update on its ad-supported tier in May, when it said it reached 40 million global monthly active users, nearly doubling the figure it had shared in January. That announcement came during Upfronts, when media companies make their pitches to advertisers.\n\nNetflix also announced in May it would launch its own advertising platform, ending a partnership with Microsoft for that technology. It’s rolled out the platform in Canada and plans to launch it in the U.S. by the end of the second quarter next year. It plans to set the platform live everywhere by the end of 2025.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/12/netflix-ad-supported-tier-70-million-monthly-users.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/12/netflix-ad-supported-tier-70-million-monthly-users.html)",

        "content": "**1.0 Introduction**\n\neBay was originally called “AuctionWeb” when it launched in 1995. Its founder, Pierre Omidyar, created it as part of his website to experiment with online auctions. He listed his broken laser pointer for sale and sold it for **$14.83**. When he asked if the buyer understood the laser pointer was broken, the buyer responded that he was a collector and was still interested.\n\nIn 1997 the name was changed to eBay, and the rest is history.\n\nThe most expensive item ever sold on eBay is the **Gigayacht**, a 405-foot luxury yacht designed by Frank Mulder. It was purchased for **$168 million** by the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.\n\nThe auctions for a lunch with Warren Buffett also took place on eBay, with the 2022 auction being won by a bid of $19 million.\n\n\n\n**2.0 Competition**\n\neBay has been primarily known as the auction go-to-place, as well as the place to go for 2nd hand items. Although there is an overlap with its competitors, there is no doubt that it dominates the 2nd hand market, especially for trading cards and collectibles and it can be labeled as the market leader in Recommerce and auctions.\n\nIts competition comes in different forms:\n\n* **Amazon & Walmart Marketplace** \\- Global eCommerce platforms focused on new products sold by businesses and third-party sellers.\n* **Facebook Marketplace & Craigslist** \\- Local Recommerce platforms enabling individuals to buy/sell used items within their communities.\n* **Etsy** \\- Global eCommerce with a focus on handmade and unique products, though it includes some Recommerce elements for vintage goods.\n\neBay supports eCommerce, but that is a more crowded market, where Amazon is king.\n\n  \n**3.0 Its business model**\n\neBay’s revenue comes in many forms:\n\n* Final value fees\n* Listing fees\n* Feature fees\n* Store subscription fees\n* Sale of advertisements\n* Revenue sharing arrangements\n* Shipping fees, etc.\n\nUltimately, they can be grouped into 2 buckets: Transaction revenue (\\~85%) and advertising (\\~15%).\n\n\n\n**3.1 The key metrics that do not add up**\n\nIn companies of this kind, two important metrics are:\n\n* The **Gross Merchandise Value**, also known as “GMV”, represents the value of all products sold through the website.\n* The **take-rate** represents their share of the GMV.\n\nLet’s have a look at both of them.\n\nThe GMV increased from $73b in 2019 (prior to the pandemic) to $87b during the pandemic and is not back to $74b. However, if you follow their take-rate, it went up from 9% to 14% between 2019 and LTM. But this is slightly misleading. eBay changed the definition of their \"take-rate\" in 2022.\n\nIt used to be calculated as **net transaction revenue** divided by **GMV** and it changed to **net revenue** divided by **GMV**.\n\nSo, I opted for an alternative take-rate, which is definitely not a generally accepted definition. That is: **operating profit** divided by GMV. The outcome is the % of the GMV that is kept by eBay after covering all the operating expenses. There, the increase is minimal, and this adjusted take rate fluctuates around 3%.\n\n\n\n**4.0 Historical Financial Performance**\n\nAlthough its revenue is flat (\\~$10 billion), eBay is a cash-generating machine, bringing **\\~$2 billion** in free cash flow per year *(\\~1.4 billion if SBC is subtracted)*. \n\nBehind the scenes, there’s something else worth noting. Not only has the revenue not been growing, but the composition has changed.\n\n\n\n|Revenue by geography (in $m)|2021|LTM|Change (in %)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|U.S.|$5.048|$5.185|3%|\n|U.K.|$1.913|$1.588|\\-17%|\n|China|$856|$1.124|31%|\n|Germany|$1.249|$967|\\-23%|\n|Rest of the world|$1.354|$1.402|4%|\n|Total|$10.420|$10.266|\\-1%|\n\nUK and Germany are contributing significantly less, and this decline is being compensated by growth primarily coming from China. Given that China comes with its additional risks (and competition), it can be argued that the revenue today is of lower quality than the revenue back in 2021.\n\nThis could indicate that the penetration rate in the U.S. and Western Europe is at its peak and the average long-term growth that can be expected is around the 3% historical inflation rate.\n\n\n\n**5.0 Capital allocation**\n\nA huge focus of the management has been returning cash to the shareholders.\n\nSince 2019, the company returned almost $28 billion ($25b via buybacks and $3b via dividends). A lot of this came from the company’s free cash flow, but part of it came from divestitures:\n\n* Sold 80% of eBay Korea to eMart.\n* Reduced ownership in Aurelia (the privatized Adevinta entity).\n\n  \nThis led to a reduction of the number of shares outstanding by 40%. This is also a very impressive number if it is presented in isolation. However, half of the repurchases were done in 2020 and 2021, when the share price was quite elevated. In hindsight, that might not have been the best decision.\n\nOne notable long-term investment of theirs is Adyen, where they own 404k shares due to the warrants based on processing volume criteria. Given Adyen’s share price, these are worth around half a billion dollars.\n\n  \n**6.0 Valuation**\n\nThis is the time to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.\n\nThe key question to answer is - **Given what is known today, how much is the company worth?**\n\nBased on everything mentioned above, my best estimate for revenue growth is in line with inflation, as this is a mature market with a high penetration rate in the developed countries.\n\nSimilarly, I do not see any levers that the company can pull to significantly increase its profitability. For that reason, I keep its operating margin at 21%.\n\nBased on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is $20.7b (**$43/share**), significantly below today’s share price of $62.\n\nHere’s how the valuation (per share) changes if you have different assumptions than mine regarding the revenue growth & the operating margin:\n\n\n\n|Revenue / Operating margin|19%|21%|23%|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|0% ($10.3b)|$29|$31|$33|\n|34% ($13.8b)|$40|$43|$47|\n|65% ($17.0b)|$47|$50|$54|\n\n\n\nIf the DCF model is reversed, for eBay to be fairly valued today, it needs to **double in size over the next decade** (average annual revenue growth of 7%) and **increase its operating margin to 23%.** Although this isn’t impossible, there’s no evidence that eBay’s growth will re-accelerate.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this post, feel free to share your thoughts.",
