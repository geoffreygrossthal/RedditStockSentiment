And that once demand returns to normal, businesses will continue to post record high profits. \n\nThis idea couldn't be farther from the truth. [Data published in the WSJ](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/10/coronavirus-markets-economy-corporate-debt/) on March 10, 2020 showed that: \n\n* 1 in 6 publicly traded U.S. companies did not earn enough to cover their interest payments before the COVID-19 crises. \n* In the first half of 2019, 40% of all leveraged loans went to companies with a debt-to-earnings ratio of 6:1 or higher. \n* [the IMF conducted a stress test](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/14/investing/corporate-debt-coronavirus/index.html) that showed an economic crises half the size of 2008 would put 40% of corporate debt at risk of default in the 8 of the largest world economies.\n\nI find it very odd that stories like these were EVERYWHERE in March, 2020. Then as stocks began to skyrocket and firms started making back losses, they practically vanished from the media. \n\nIf you are comfortable with these debt levels and believe we can keep increasing debt without a market contraction, then by all means continue to invest. Just wanted to get the information out since I haven't see much of this lately.",
