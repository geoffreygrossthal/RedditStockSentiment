        "content": "Started this for her on her 4th birthday 14 months ago. Initial of $100 and another $50 every month since. She’s been buying only companies she knows, Apple, Disney, Netflix, Tesla, McDonalds, Dominos, Tyson Foods, Nike, Starbucks, Target, etc… She’s down 8% but that’s better than me for the same time frame. Dollar Cost Averaging and big profitable companies FTW! I should just buy $1K every month of the same thing as her. Just today she asked if she could buy stock in the hotel we’re staying at because the pool is awesome. $50 of Marriot!",
