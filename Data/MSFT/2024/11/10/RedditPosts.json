Nearly all my trades are with options 1 month to 6 months out, as i find that the added “breathing room” allows for better psychology when committing to a trade. Majority of gains came from SPY calls, RDDT Calls and shares, UPST Earnings Calls and Shares, and TSLA scalps. Completed 65 trades this week, 42 profitable, 23 losing money. ",
