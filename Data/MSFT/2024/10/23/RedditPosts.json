        "content": "* Tesla reported third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analysts’ estimates even as revenue came in just shy of expectations.\n\nHere’s what the company reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:\n\n* **Earnings per share:** 72 cents vs. 58 cents expected\n* **Revenue:** $25.18 billion vs. $25.37 billion expected\n\nRevenue increased 8% in the quarter from $23.35 billion a year earlier. Net income rose to about $2.17 billion, or 62 cents a share, from $1.85 billion, or 53 cents s share, a year ago.\n\nTesla’s profit margins were bolstered by $739 million in automotive regulatory credit revenue during the quarter. The company has also been offering an array of discounts and incentives to spur sales.\n\nAutomotive revenue increased 2% to $20 billion from $19.63 billion in the same period a year earlier. Energy generation and storage revenue soared 52% to $2.38 billion, while services and other revenue jumped 29% to $2.79 billion.\n\nOperating margin was reported at 10.8% of sales to improve from last quarter's mark of 6.3%, and top last year's mark of 7.6%. Total GAAP gross margin was 19.8% vs. 17.9% a year ago and 18.0% in the prior quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.67 billion vs. $3.76 billion a year ago. For the quarter, the EV juggernaut's adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 18.5% of sales from 16.1% a year ago.\n\n# \n\nTesla had already disclosed 462,890 deliveries for Q3. The electric vehicle maker said it produced 469,796 vehicles during the quarter. Tesla noted that 3% of the deliveries were subject to operating lease accounting. For reference, Tesla delivered 443,956 vehicles in Q2 of this year and 435,059 vehicles in Q3 of last year. Tesla's  all-time deliveries record was 484,507 vehicles in Q4 of 2023. Looking ahead, Tesla reiterated that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025.\n\n# More than just EVs\n\nTesla said energy storage deployments decreased sequentially in Q3 to a record 6.9 GWh, but were up 75% Y/Y. Overall, Tesla said energy services and other businesses are becoming increasingly profitable parts of the company. \"As energy storage products continue to ramp, and our vehicle fleet continues to grow, we are expecting continued profit growth from these businesses over time,\" noted TSLA. The company also said that it deployed and is training ahead of schedule on a 29k H100 cluster at Gigafactory Texas, where it expects to have 50k H100 capacity by the end of October.\n\n# Balance sheet\n\nTesla ended the quarter with a cash position of $33.6 billion. The sequential increase of $2.9 billion was a result of positive free cash flow of $2.7 billion. Operating cash flow was $6.3 billion during the quarter.\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nWe delivered strong results in Q3 with growth in vehicle deliveries both sequentially and year-on-year, resulting in record third-quarter volumes. We also recognized our second-highest quarter of regulatory credit revenues as other OEMs are still behind on meeting emissions requirements.\n\nOur cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle came down to its lowest level ever at \\~$35,100. In order to continue accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy, we need to make EVs affordable for everyone, including making total cost of ownership per mile competitive with all forms of transportation. Preparations remain underway for our offering of new vehicles – including more affordable models – which we will begin launching in the first half of 2025. At our \"We, Robot\" event on October 10, we detailed our long-term goal of offering autonomous transport with a cost per mile below rideshare, personal car ownership, and even public transit.\n\nThe Energy business achieved another strong quarter with a record gross margin. Additionally, the Megafactory in Lathrop produced 200 Megapacks in a week, and Powerwall deployments reached a record for the second quarter in a row as we continue to ramp Powerwall 3.\n\nDespite sustained macroeconomic headwinds and others pulling back on EV investments, we remain focused on expanding our vehicle and energy product lineup, reducing costs and making critical investments in AI projects and production capacity. We believe these efforts will allow us to capitalize on the ongoing transition in the transportation and energy sectors.",

I currently hold positions in AMZN, AAPL, COST, NTDOY, BRK.B, VOO, and MSFT.\n\nDo I stay with what I have and pump more in? Anything you’d add? Do I diversify into something besides stocks/ETF’s?",

        "content": "Currently holding a portfolio of 70% stocks (blue chip) and 30% ETFs (mostly SP500) in Europe. My problem is that the asset allocation is almost 100% equity. Now, don't get me wrong, it's been performing well enough, but I am starting to get worried about potential downturns (I survived 2022 successfully).\n\nI'll admit I am a bit hesitant to sell (portions of) the high-performing stocks (AAPL, MSFT, JPM, AMZN) since they are doing very well, but I am aware that the current profile is too aggressive. Do you have any tips on how to do mediate risk gradually? My risk appetite is medium, and I still have some years left to retirement, so growth is definitely a goal right now. Thanks!",
