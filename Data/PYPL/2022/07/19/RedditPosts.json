He exercised 200 call options, or 20,000 shares, the disclosure states. The disclosure raised eyebrows, as Reuters reported that the Senate could vote on a bill that contains billions of dollars in subsidies within the semiconductor industry as early as Tuesday. \n\nCurtis Houck, managing editor of right-leaning media watchdog NewsBusters, said it was \"no accident that the liberal media have made the decision to ignore\" the story that could damage Pelosi. \n\n\"For those that are aware of it, they have zero comprehension and/or shame to realize how it's a quintessential story of how the elites work for their own financial benefit, not that of the American people,\" Houck told Fox News Digital. \n\nMeanwhile, Nancy Pelosi's office has attempted to distance the House Speaker from her husband’s recent stock trades. \n\n\"The Speaker does not own any stocks. As you can see from the required disclosures, with which the Speaker fully cooperates, these transactions are marked ‘SP’ for Spouse. The Speaker has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions,\" spokesman Drew Hammill told FOX Business. \n\nIn 2020, Republican Sen. Richard Burr, N.C., and other high-profile lawmakers came under fire for stock sales in the run-up to the COVID-19 pandemic that were suspected to have been made based on confidential information about the pending outbreak. CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS and NBC all covered the story. \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" even featured a lengthy commentary about it. \n\n Charlie Gasparino appeared on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" on Monday to discuss whether the move could be insider trading. \n\n\"This dude is a rising star on Wall Street,\" Gasparino joked before taking a serious tone. \n\n\"Obviously this brings up the notion, is this insider trading? Is she giving him some tips? We should point out that the SEC and the DOJ have brought cases on insider tips via pillow talk. Trust me on this. It’s happened,\" he said. \"I don’t believe this hits the insider trading bar… a lot of information about this legislation was bouncing around, it has to be material, non-public, stolen, misappropriated. It kind of doesn’t hit those barriers. But what this does hit is limousine liberalism, arrogance on steroids.\" ",
