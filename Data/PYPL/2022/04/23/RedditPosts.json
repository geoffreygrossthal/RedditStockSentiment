Elon confirmed their authenticity on Twitter by saying: \n\n\"Yeah, but I didn’t leak it to NYT. They must have got it through friends of friends. I heard from multiple people at TED that Gates still had half billion short against Tesla, which is why I asked him, so it’s not exactly top secret.\"\n\n\\[Elon's reply source: [https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1517702987359133696](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1517702987359133696)\\]",
