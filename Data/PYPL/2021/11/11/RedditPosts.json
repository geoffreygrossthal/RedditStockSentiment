That could just be a tiny fraction if Taiwan has more serious future issues such as natural disasters or China invasion, which could cost businesses TRILLIONS in damages to companies such as:  Ford (F) , General Motors (GM) , and Toyota (TM), Dell Technologies (DELL),  Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), AMD, NVDA, and many more.\n\n\n>The group, which also includes the governors of auto-producing states like Alabama, said the shortage had cost automakers 2.2 million vehicles and affected 575,000 jobs in the industry.\n\n>The semiconductor funding passed the U.S. Senate earlier this year by 68-32 as part of the broader U.S. Innovation and Competition Act, or USICA. But it has not passed the House of Representatives.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/us/nine-governors-press-us-lawmakers-pass-semiconductor-funding-bill-2021-11-10/\n\nEdit: this news has been censored and removed from:  r/finance r/Economics r/StockMarket .
