        "content": "GSAT is my speculative play right now. Looks like it is (maybe was) a good runner, with apple using it for their satellite cell service, and non-emergency use/satellite text coming in 2025.\n\nProblem: SpaceX/Starlink and GSAT are in a battle over satellite radio bands. FCC dismissed SpaceX's request to basically take over GSAT's dedicated section of bandwidth.\n\nBut Musk is now firmly latched onto future POTUS, in what is certain to become a grifty political-economic symbiosis.\n\nWhat's the liklihood Musk tries to court government favors from the white house/FCC to give SpaceX a (probably illegal, but laws don't matter anymore) leg up?",
