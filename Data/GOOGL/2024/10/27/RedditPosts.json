        "content": "Mid 30s here. Advisor yearly fees are around 1.6%. They're strictly just overseeing this account and nothing else, taking out their quarterly fees.\n\nStarted with around 250k in 2022. Account is held in Schwab, value is about now $276k. (Dividends have been taken out quarterly (total taken out around $25k since 2022, will stop these and just re invest them).\n\nThe advisor has invested the majority of my portfolio into multiple equities (NVDA, AVGO, SMCI, QCOM, COHR, IRM, PANW, AAPL, GOOGL, CAT, ZS, etc...) Only 1% of my holdings is in USBSX.\n\nWould I be better off just putting everything in a 3 fund type of portfolio and meeting with a fee based advisor a few times a year?",

I would appreciate name or links?",
