        "content": "Edit: stock price movements\\*\\* to be more specific in the post title\n\nI’d like to start off by saying I’m invested in some fairly safe picks (ETFs, AAPL, MSFT, etc) so I’m not worried when I see that the market is red or that my portfolio is down. That being said, on weekends when there is no market movement, I feel like I’m missing a whole part of my life. I really enjoy checking my portfolio and watching the movement throughout my day, whether it be up, down, or sideways. I’ve even started to dread the weekends because it’s less fun looking through tickers and seeing what stocks are mooning/plummeting. Anyone else feel the same way? How do you cope?\n\nEdit 2: To address a common comment: yes, I do other things outside of sitting at my computer looking at tickers. I have other hobbies and people to talk to. That being said, investing is fun (which it should be!) and I miss it during the weekends. I'm lacking someone that brings me enjoyment when the market is closed.\n\nEdit 2.1: “lacking someone” should be “lacking something”.",
