        "content": "In 1997 there was a study conducted by Duke University[1], that if you followed the recommendation of the best 10% of all market-timing newsletters, you would have earned a 12.6% annualized return from 1991 through 1995.\n\nBut if you ignored them and just held your positions, you would have earned 16.4%.\n\nIt's worth adding that the operation costs weren't included in that equation, as well as capital gain taxes.\n\nMy biggest problem when it comes to investing is trying to find that one gold advice, that would help me make 500% returns. On Reddit there's plenty of TSLA yay and nay sayers, AMZN fanatics and opponents, AAPL fan boys and haters who will try to convince everyone around why their opinion is the most valid and accurate. \n\nFuck 'em. Do your own research. Look at the company earning reports. Look at the political climate and try to deduce how the company may react to it. Commit and don't look back. \n\nSure, it's good to see what's new once in a while, learn what other people think. But basing your financial moves on other people, even if it's Warren Buffet will make you lose money in the long term.\n\n\n\n[1] \"Grading the performance of market-timing newsletters\" by John R.
