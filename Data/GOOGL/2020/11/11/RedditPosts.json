Ko­dak said it in­curred about $5.1 mil­lion in com­pen­sa-tion ex­penses re­lated to the op­tions in the third quar­ter.\n\nKo­dak Fi­nance Chief David Bull­win­kle said on an earn­ings call Tues­day that the com­pany had dis­cov­ered de­fi­cien­cies in its con­trols that had failed to pre­vent the “unau­tho­rized is­suance” of the com­pa­ny’s stock.",
