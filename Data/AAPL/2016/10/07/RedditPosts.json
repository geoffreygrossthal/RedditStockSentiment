I feel mocked, every time I get a notification while having my device open. Sometimes the notification responds, sometimes not. And swiping the notifications up to make them disappear rarely works! That's so annoying! And if it overlays your screen, you have no options. Just great. Also I don't want to answer every mail in GMail that I open through notifications, I just want to read them :(.\n\nThe notifications are really ugly, what's with those rounded edges and the bright white?\n\nEasily, one of the most annoying changes in iOS 10.\n\nEdit: Alright, I guess that many of you feel the same way. Now, we all know that the design of notifications in iOS 9 was great, can we all agree to submit this feedback to Apple again? It's not wrong to do this, it's what we want from our most used devices. If there is anything wrong with that, your opinion is welcome of course.\n\nMaybe Apple could develop a more fluent experience for notifications, maybe even a bug free one, again.\n\n^P.S.: ^Esthetic ^should ^be ^a ^valid ^alternative ^to ^aesthetics ^;).",
