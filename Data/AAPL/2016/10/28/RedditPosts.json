        "content": "You need a dongle to use your iPhone 7 with your old earbuds. You can't charge your phone from your new MacBook Pro without a special USB-c/lightning cable. You need a dongle to plug just about anything in to the MacBook Pro. \n\nTechnology is supposed to simplify your life and solve existing problems. Not cause more headaches. \n\nApple is a complete mess right now. I have to play out usage scenarios with their new products. \"What if I got to bobs house and want to play some of my music on his stereo, I'll need to bring an adapter!\"  \"What if im at work and I want to charge my phone through my laptop, better not forget the special cable!\"\n\nWtf Apple?
