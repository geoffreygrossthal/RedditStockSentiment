        "content": "It was expected but this means that if you want to buy headphones that work across all your apple devices, theres no avoiding using a dongle unless its wireless. This is insane.\n\nApple should have standardized thunderbolt 3 on all devices, or find a use for lighting on the pro. If you buy beautiful lighting headphones, you wont be able to use them on your Macbook pro. On the standard macbook, i'd understand. But the pro has always been there for versatility.\nNot everyone is ready to do the jump to wireless headphones with delayed audio.",
