        "content": "Before every iPhone release, all everyone talks about is how all they want in an iPhone is better battery life, and we finally got it! Granted, it's only 1-3 extra hours (depending on how you use it), but to me that's significant, especially when you consider the impressive performance improvements.\n\nBTW, they also improved the front facing camera, improved the back facing camera (a lot), added a faster LTE radio, added stereo speakers,added water resistance, added dust resistance, added sleek new colors, improved the antenna design, doubled the storage, improved the display, and more, again all while improving battery life and graphic and CPU performance (a lot).  Not a bad upgrade in my opinion.  I do completely understand why losing the headphone jack is frustrating for a lot of people, but for me and a lot of other people who have already been using Bluetooth headphones, this is a non issue.\n\nEDIT: Since a lot of people are throwing this out there, I'll just add that I am in no way saying getting rid of the headphone jack was a good idea, in fact for most people this completely sucks.  All I'm saying is that for those people who don't mind the sacrifices you have to make w/ Bluetooth (shittier sound quality/something else to charge...), the iPhone 7 is a great update.  And surprisingly, the are a decent amount of people out there that already own Bluetooth headphones and actually prefer them, including me. ",
