        "content": "I'd appreciate any and all feedback to see if I feel I'm on track or not and your perspective on my take. I know Okta took the hit after the social engineering \"hack\", but there's no doubt they're still the leader in the IAM space. I believe there's way more upside, but I also realize that they \\*could\\* be a serious M&A target.\n\n**Executive Investment Summary: Okta, Inc.**\n\n**Overview**\n\nOkta, Inc. is a leading provider of identity and access management (IAM) solutions, serving enterprises globally with secure authentication systems. Its strong revenue growth, cash flow, and leadership in the cybersecurity market make it an attractive acquisition target.\n\n\n\n***Key Financial Highlights***\n\n\\- Revenue (TTM): $2.45 billion, reflecting 16.2% YoY growth.\n\n\\- Profitability:\n\n\\- Net Income: -$136 million (improved from -$355 million YoY).\n\n\\- EBITDA: -$145 million.\n\n\\- Cash Flow Positive: Despite unprofitability, generating $607M in free cash flow.\n\n\\- Cash Position: $2.2 billion; current ratio of 1.83 (strong liquidity).\n\n\\- Debt Profile: $1.297 billion in total debt; net debt of $820 million (manageable).\n\n\\- Market Cap: \\~$12–15 billion.\n\n\\- Valuation Multiples: Acquisition valuation estimated at $16–18 billion, reflecting 6–9x revenue multiples.\n\n\n\n**Strategic Acquisition Rationale**\n\n\n\nMarket Opportunity\n\nThe IAM market is expanding due to hybrid work and zero-trust security models. Okta’s leadership in this high-demand space adds immediate value to acquirers.\n\n\n\nSynergies\n\n1. Revenue Synergies:\n\n\\- Cross-selling within SaaS, cloud, and cybersecurity ecosystems.\n\n\\- Increases customer retention via integrated security offerings.\n\n2. Cost Synergies:\n\n\\- Consolidation of R&D, sales, and administrative functions.\n\n\n\n**Tax Advantages**\n\n1. Net Operating Losses (NOLs):\n\n\\- Okta’s significant NOLs can offset taxable income for the acquirer under U.S. tax rules (IRC Section 382), reducing the acquirer’s overall tax burden.\n\n\\- For cash-flow-positive acquirers like *Microsoft* or *Salesforce*, this could be an immediate financial benefit.\n\n2. R&D Tax Credits:\n\n\\- Okta’s investment in IAM technology qualifies for R&D tax credits, which the acquirer can leverage to reduce tax liability.\n\n3. Capital Gains Protection:\n\n\\- If the acquirer has large realized gains in 2024, purchasing Okta could offset these with acquisition-related costs.\n\n\n\nTiming Considerations\n\n2024: Lower valuation; earlier synergies and immediate tax benefits from NOLs.\n\n2025: Higher valuation but lower operational risk as Okta achieves profitability milestones.\n\n\n\n**Potential Acquirers and Recommendations**\n\nAcquirer: Microsoft\n\nTiming Recommendation: Acquire in 2024\n\nWhy? Integrates into Azure AD; removes a competitor; strengthens security leadership. Early acquisition maximizes synergies and tax advantages from Okta’s NOLs.\n\n\n\nAcquirer: Google (Alphabet)\n\nTiming Recommendation: Wait until 2025\n\nWhy? Conservative M&A approach; IAM complements Google Cloud; may prefer profitability first.\n\n\n\nAcquirer: Amazon (AWS)\n\nTiming Recommendation: Wait until 2025\n\nWhy? Less urgent; would act only if Microsoft or others make a move.\n\n\n\nAcquirer: Salesforce\n\nTiming Recommendation: Acquire in 2024\n\nWhy? Complements Slack and Salesforce’s SaaS stack; increases enterprise value. Tax advantages can offset acquisition costs while enhancing shareholder value.\n\n\n\nAcquirer: Cisco\n\nTiming Recommendation: Acquire in 2024\n\nWhy? Aligns with Cisco’s cybersecurity strategy; enhances subscription revenue growth. Okta’s NOLs can be applied against Cisco’s strong operating profits.\n\n\n\n**Valuation and Stock Price Impact**\n\n\n\nAcquisition Valuation\n\n2024: $16–18 billion (20–40% premium).\n\n2025: $18–22 billion, assuming profitability.\n\n\n\nStock Price Impact\n\n2024 Acquisition:\n\n\\- Stock Price Range: $95.81–$107.78 per share.\n\n\\- Upside: +29% to +45% (from \\~$74.51 current price).\n\n\n\n2025 Acquisition:\n\n\\- Stock Price Range: $107–$130 per share.\n\n\\- Upside: +44% to +75%.\n\n\n\n**Final Recommendation**\n\n\n\nFor Acquirers\n\n2024 Acquisition:\n\n\\- Microsoft, Salesforce, Cisco: Act now to secure market share, synergies, and tax advantages while Okta is undervalued.\n\n\n\n2025 Acquisition:\n\n\\- Google, Amazon: Wait for profitability milestones, reducing operational risks.\n\n\n\nFor Stockholders\n\nHold the stock for potential 29–75% upside over the next 12–18 months through organic growth or an acquisition.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOkta is a prime acquisition target with robust growth potential, strategic synergies, and significant tax advantages for tech giants. While aggressive acquirers like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Cisco should act in 2024 to maximize these benefits, more conservative companies like Google and Amazon may wait until 2025 for improved profitability metrics. Either way, Okta presents a compelling investment with projected stock price increases of $95–$130 per share.\n\n  \nDISCLAIMER: I'm already a shareholder",

        "content": "Alright, degenerates. Rivian isn’t just the dorky little brother of Tesla anymore—it’s the ex-nerd who’s going to show up at the 10-year reunion ripped and in a tux, ready to steal the prom queen. This play has all the makings of a **10x banger** if you’re willing to hold on like your life depends on it. Buckle up, because this ride is going 0 to 69 faster than you can swipe right.\n\n## Why Rivian Is About to Deliver\n\n**Tesla’s Fumbling the Ball** \n\nElon’s gone off the deep end and is alienating the very crowd that made EVs sexy to begin with. Progressive elites? Millennials? The kinds of people who buy organic kale and want their car to save the planet? Yeah, they’re turning the corner to RIVN, who’s out here whispering sweet nothings about sustainability, inclusivity, and not being a hot mess. Basically, Tesla’s stuck doing the walk of shame while Rivian’s already at brunch ordering mimosas.\n\n**How Rivian Could Ride Trump’s EV Rollercoaster**\n\nYou’d think Trump and EVs go together like oil and water, but here’s the twist: RIVN could totally benefit from his likely “America First” policies. With Rivian’s production fully based in the U.S., any federal push for domestic manufacturing would be a tailwind. Meanwhile, Trump’s cozy relationship with Elon might have TSLA in the spotlight, but every infrastructure boost for Tesla chargers indirectly benefits RIVN since its vehicles now play nice with Tesla's Supercharger network. Most any other policy that benefits TSLA will help RIVN as well. Rivian’s set to snag the benefits without the baggage, making it the sneaky winner here. Everyone’s FOMOing into TSLA right now, but RIVN is the sleeper play here, and it’s only a matter of time until the market realizes this.\n\n**New Models That’ll Make You Feel Things** \n\nLet’s talk about Rivian’s R2 SUV and its new lineup. Starting at $45K, it’s the hot-but-affordable option that’s ready to steal hearts (and market share). Tri-motor setup? Level 3 autonomy? Integration with Tesla’s Supercharger network? That’s not just sexy—that’s full-blown EV porn. This isn’t a one-night stand; Rivian’s building long-term market appeal. And if that $45k price tag isn’t inclusive enough for you Wendy’s employees, they’re adding a cheaper R3 model just for you (dumpster price point model still TBD).\n\n**Efficiency: More Bang for Their Buck** \n\nSure, Rivian’s been burning through cash faster than you can dump your paycheck into hookers and blow, but they’ve learned to keep it tight. Cutting the Georgia plant saved $2.25B, and now they’ve found [a sugar daddy in Volkswagen to the tune of $5 billion](https://www.spglobal.com/mobility/en/research-analysis/rivian-volkswagen-production-forecast.html), exactly what they need to hold them over until their new models roll out. That’s efficiency, baby.\n\n**Analysts Are Hot for RIVN**\n\n Some of the suits on Wall Street are swooning over Rivian. Their buy rating and price target of $15.67 give it a potential upside of 54%. They’re hyped about Rivian’s leaner operations, aggressive production targets, and a fat pipeline of new EVs. But there are still plenty of doubters who like losing money: [a short interest of 18%](https://fintel.io/ss/us/rivn) means the minute this stock turns around, the squeeze will make it run.\n\nRIVN shot from current levels all the way to $18 when the VW news first dropped, plus the recent pop to $12 when VW upped their commitment from $5B to $5.8B, but they’re now being valued the same as they were before the deal existed. People who think a cash injection of half the company’s market cap isn’t going to move the needle are delusional. Not to mention they have $6.73B cash on hand, and they’re only valued at $10B? Seems like a steal to me.  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/tc3jgmanu32e1.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b4d1888d8fc95e1f6fc9412032bb443304282aa\n\n## The Risks (Nothing to See Here)\n\n**Dilution** \n\nRivian’s diluted more shares than a frat house dilutes vodka in jungle juice. But that jungle juice is funding some spicy R&D and scaling production, which means the hangover might just be worth it. And with VW’s cash infusion (with potentially more in the future?) and affordable models on the horizon, they might not need to rely on dilution going forward.\n\n**Cash Burn**\n\nRivian’s like the guy spending money he doesn’t have to impress his date. Sure, it’s a gamble, but if those new models hit like I think they will, it’s a gamble that pays off big. Plus with Trump in the White House, do you honestly think he’s going to let American manufacturing jobs disappear when that’s all he talks about? Hell no, he’ll make sure RIVN stays alive until their investments pay off.\n\n## TL;DR: \n\nRIVN isn’t just another EV play—it’s *the EV play* for those with the balls to handle a little risk. With Tesla already overvalued and fumbling its game, Trump protectionism acting as the ultimate wingman, and Rivian’s lineup of models hotter than a summer fling, the potential upside is enormous. Analysts see at least 50% upside, with room to double. This stock’s the real deal, and I’m strapping in for the ride.\n\nAnd if I haven’t sold you on it, take it instead from this guy who turned $182k into $11.7 million:  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nf2e38yju32e1.png?width=966&format=png&auto=webp&s=021287bb576580c5ce190c54c2f8b7495f521944\n\nPosition: $35k in shares, 20 $35 Jan 2026 calls, 10 $20 Jan 2027 calls  \n\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ev420hmou32e1.jpg?width=1179&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1150f94bd0b078404049d6534e0b469878bec71\n\nEDIT: u/Additional-Ad-1021 and u/geraldor732 have some good points below too; expansion to Europe and potential for AMZN fleet purchases could be huge!",

        "content": "Micron is probably one of the best opportunities to pick up some shares. Long-term, this company is set to do very well. As one of the only large chip manufacturers with most of its manufacturing presence in the U.S., the company is poised for expansion.\n\nWhile Intel is set to receive the largest amount from the CHIPS Act ($8.5 billion directly) and a further $11 billion in loans combined with additional tax credits, Micron is not far behind, with plans to receive $6.14 billion in direct funding.\n\nThis is meaningful because Micron is a smaller, newer company, and as a result, it has much more potential for growth compared to an already established giant like Intel.\n\nIn addition to the CHIPS Act, the United States currently has bipartisan support to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., which would be more effective than imposing costly tariffs on China without building up a domestic manufacturing presence.\n\nMicron is currently a key supplier of high-bandwidth memory (HBM3E) for NVIDIA's Blackwell GPUs. Although they are not solely supplying their chips to NVIDIA, having an initial edge in what will likely be the leading chip line (NVIDIA's Blackwell line) will be crucial.\n\nMicron’s customization options for customers are also a significant advantage, though it’s not currently getting much attention.\n\nAdditionally, Micron's new chips provide major breakthroughs in energy savings:\n\n* **HBM3E (High Bandwidth Memory 3E)**: This advanced memory technology offers over 1.2 TB/s bandwidth and is built on Micron's 1β process node. It delivers a 2.5x improvement in performance per watt compared to previous generations.\n* **LPDDR5**: Targeted at mobile devices, Micron's LPDDR5 DRAM provides 50% faster data speeds and 20% more power efficiency than earlier LPDDR generations, resulting in 5-10% better battery life for applications like 8K video and virtual reality.\n* **1β DRAM Process Node**: Micron's 1β (1-beta) DRAM technology enhances power efficiency by 15% and increases bit density by 35% over previous nodes.\n\nAlthough Micron has faced challenges in the past, with its revenue recovering from its 2022 high of nearly $30 billion, this provides a good opportunity for a potential bounce back, which could ultimately drive its share price higher.\n\nWith AI expansion and the new U.S. policies, I anticipate domestic chip manufacturers will receive favorable treatment in terms of tax breaks and other incentives, further strengthening their position over foreign competitors.\n\nWhile the share price has fallen from $150 down to $100 at the time of writing, I see a strong possibility of it bouncing back to previous levels, as long as they continue the work they are doing now.\n\nAnd although people are questioning the high P/E ratios, I expect earnings growth to bring this ratio under control in future quarters. Besides, we have seen stocks with high P/E ratios perform exceptionally well based solely on their growth potential.\n\n",

Yolo’d 40k last year on June (yes I know long term capital gains thank god).\n\nOkay! So. Their last earning report was missed… WHY?! Recently they were running promotions during the past months-  marketing customers switch brokage (robinhood  was essentially burning their cash) which made up a huge percentage of their expenses in the short term.Practically sacrificing CASH for customer loyalty. It was an edgy but risky move. It wasn’t a no brainer that they missed their recent earnings report by a small percentage. This is their game plan. Hood’s expectation is that… customers are more likely to invest with that said capital once they see it. ALSO… since the promotion is about to end, (I think it has already) their upcoming earnings report will beat expectations by a TON. If not, definitely the next one. Due to saved expenses. Compared to Coinbase, Robinhood is the jack of all trades where young investors will have an entry to learn how to invest. People believe that $hood is undervalued, but I confidently say it is still super undervalued. Keep in mind. Coinbase is 300+ in shares price because they withhold 50 BILLION plus of crypto equity. \n\nFunny thing is that.. I was using Charles Schwab the other day and it was fucking hard to find my entry cost. Their mobile UI is terrible to say the least. Spent 5-7 minutes tapping buttons and I STILL couldn’t find my cost.\n\nAnother thing. Their recent acquisition of TradePMR- wealth management corp. This move will essentially set their ground footing towards a banking industry.. I wouldn’t be surprised if they were to acquired SOFI. Adding in Futures + Index and the desktop app that they’ve recently released, would be another reason and THE pinnacle of their success. In the future $hood will be a Bank. \n\nAll in all… I believe $hood will shoot up to $100 very easily. In the next 4-5 years  $250+. Mark my words. ",
