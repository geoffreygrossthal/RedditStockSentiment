        "content": "Embattled server maker Super Micro Computer said on Monday that it’s hired BDO as its new auditor and submitted a plan to Nasdaq detailing its efforts to regain compliance with the exchange. The shares jumped 23% in extended trading.\n\n“This is an important next step to bring our financial statements current, an effort we are pursuing with both diligence and urgency,” Super Micro CEO Charles Liang said in a statement.\n\nSuper Micro is late in filing its 2024 year-end report with the SEC, and said earlier this month that it was looking for a new accountant after its previous auditor, Ernst & Young, stepped down in October. Ernst & Young was new to the job, having just replaced Deloitte & Touche as Super Micro’s accounting firm in March 2023.\n\nSuper Micro said it told Nasdaq that it believes it will be able to file its annual report for the year ended June 30, and quarterly report for the period ended Sept. 30. The company said it will remain listed on the Nasdaq pending the exchange’s “review of the compliance plan.”\n\nShares of Super Micro soared more than twentyfold over a two year period from early 2022 until their peak in March of this year. But the stock has been hammered on troubling news about its compliance with Nasdaq. Once valued at about $70 billion, the company’s market cap was at $12.6 billion at the close on Monday, following a 16% rally during regular trading.\n\nSuper Micro has been one of the primary beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence boom, due to its relationship with Nvidia. Sales last fiscal year more than doubled to $15 billion.\n\nOn Monday, Super Micro announced that it was selling products featuring Nvidia’s next-generation AI chip called Blackwell. The company competes with vendors like Dell and Hewlett Packard Enterprise in packaging up Nvidia AI chips for other companies to access.\n\nSuper Micro was added to the S&P 500 in March, reflecting its rapidly growing business and then-soaring stock price. Less than two weeks after the index changes were announced, Super Micro reached its closing high of $118.81.\n\nThe troubles began within months. In August, Super Micro said it wouldn’t file its annual report with the SEC on time. Noted short seller Hindenburg Research then disclosed a short position in the company, and said in a report that it identified “fresh evidence of accounting manipulation.” The Wall Street Journal later reported that the Department of Justice was at the early stages of a probe into the company.\n\nThe month after announcing its report delay, Super Micro said it had received a notification from the Nasdaq, indicating that the delay in the filing of its annual report meant the company wasn’t in compliance with the exchange’s listing rules. Super Micro said the Nasdaq’s rules allowed the company 60 days to file its report or submit a plan to regain compliance. Based on that timeframe, the deadline was Monday.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/18/super-micro-hires-new-auditor-to-maintain-nasdaq-listing-shares-pop.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/18/super-micro-hires-new-auditor-to-maintain-nasdaq-listing-shares-pop.html)",

        "content": "Qualcomm said on Tuesday that it expects its push into new markets to generate an additional $22 billion per year by 2029.\n\nOf that amount, roughly $4 billion will come from PC chips, Qualcomm said at its investor day on Tuesday. The chipmaker just introduced PC processors earlier this year, when it released Snapdragon X for Windows devices.\n\nThe latest forecast marks an important milestone for Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon, who took over the company in 2021 with a promise to get past a reliance on smartphones. In fiscal 2024, Qualcomm’s handset business reported $24.86 billion in sales, about 75% of its entire chip business.\n\nQualcomm also said on Tuesday that automotive revenues would rise about 175% by 2029 to $8 billion, of which 80% is tied to contracts that have already been secured.\n\n*″*We have been on this trajectory realizing that the technologies we have developed over the many years can be very relevant to a number of different industries beyond mobile,” Amon said at the investor event.\n\nAnother $4 billion in revenue will come from industrial chips and $2 billion will come from chips for headsets, a category Qualcomm calls XR. About $4 billion of the forecast is a catch-all for other chip sales, like those for wireless headphones and tablets.\n\nQualcomm shares are up 16% this year, trailing the Nasdaq, which has gained 26%.\n\nQualcomm grew rapidly over the past decade as its modems and processors became essential parts for high-end smartphones, especially those running Google Android. Qualcomm also sells modems and related parts to Apple for its iPhones.\n\nBut the company has warned investors that Apple could choose to stop buying Qualcomm parts as soon as 2027. Qualcomm said on Tuesday that its growing businesses will more than offset any losses from Apple.\n\nQualcomm’s strategy under Amon has been to use the technology its developed for its handset chips, like modems, processors, and AI accelerators, in new markets, including cars, PCs, and virtual reality. The investor event was the first time in years that the company has given a forecast for those new markets. Qualcomm said its total addressable market is as large as $900 billion.\n\n“We put a strategy in ’21, and we’re not changing our strategy,” Amon said.\n\nLaptop and desktop chips are currently dominated by Intel, which has over 70% percent of the market, according to Mercury Research. Intel reported $29 billion in PC chip sales in its 2023.\n\n“The competitive landscape changed between the Windows and Macs,” Amon said, referring to Apple’s move in 2020 to switch from Intel to its own processors. “We saw that as an opportunity, especially as the ecosystem did not have confidence in the existing players to actually deliver a solution.”\n\nThe forecast for XR headsets also hints at the growth potential of the VR market over the next five years. Qualcomm supplies chips to many of the top headset makers, including Meta for its Quest and Ray-Bans products.\n\nWhen it comes to artificial intelligence, Qualcomm calls itself an “edge AI” company, in contrast to cloud-based AI that’s typically powered by Nvidia processors. Company officials didn’t rule out introducing data center products in an interview with CNBC.\n\nQualcomm suggested that its mobile chips will be able to run the kind of advanced AI that’s restricted to large server farms today, an indication that that company may benefit from the AI boom down the road as the technology becomes more efficient.\n\n“What you can run on the cloud last year, you can run on the device this year,” Durga Malladi, Qualcomm’s senior vice president in charge of planning, said at the event.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/19/qualcomm-says-it-expects-4-billion-in-pc-sales-by-2029.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/19/qualcomm-says-it-expects-4-billion-in-pc-sales-by-2029.html)",

        "content": "I swear on my mother’s eyes. I’m sitting there like a fing genius looking at my hood gambling account, staring at the SMCI chart and reading all this bullshit regards are spewing on twitter about the stock getting delisted. Luckly, I just came out of a similar trade on B.Riley and kinda figured if those frauds can get away with not filing financials on time for over 180 days and they are still trading, there is no way SMCI will get delisted.\n\nI buy 250 $34.5 strike weekly calls on SMCI at $0.50 a pop. That’s a \\~$12,500, baby position babbyyy. Why $34.5 calls? idk whats funnier than $34? $34.5. Also I looked at where it dropped when EY announced they wouldn't proceed as their auditors amd $34.5 is about the level they closed at that day. Finally, $34.5 is within my personal risk tolerance. guh\n\nToday, I’m minding my own business, scrolling Reddit, eating a sandwich, watching Ana De Armas AI Porn, minding my own business. My phone buzzes, and it’s my buddy. This guy texts me out of nowhere, “Man, I think I’m fucked. I sold $34.5 naked calls on SMCI this week. Thought it’d be easy money.”\n\nSo I’m like, waiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.. I check my broker app and look at the open interest on these contracts, and my jaw hits the goddamn floor. The open interest is 257. lol. **257 contracts**, and your boy here owns **250** of them. I’m the goddamn other side of his trade! I'm the guy that said yuuuuuuuuuup I'll take those off your hands sir. \n\nIf everything holds up and SMCI opens strong tomorrow, this guy is about to be bent over a financial barrel, down 500% at open (das what the app is saying rn at least). He thought he was playing it safe, slinging naked calls like he’s DFV or something, and now he’s unknowingly writing me a fat f\\*\\*\\*ing check for $62,000 (so far).\n\nHe knows I bought SMCI calls. I mentioned it in passing, like, “Yeah, I’m in on SMCI this week.” But he doesn’t know **how many** or **what strike**. I didn’t tell him I went full-blown degenerate with $12.5K on a strike so far out of the money.\n\nNow I’m sitting here, “Do I tell him?” Like, “Hey bro, funny story, you’re about to owe me your next three paychecks because I’m holding all the cards—and by cards, I mean your fuckiing calls.” Or do I keep my mouth shut and let the market gods do what they do? I feel bad, but not that bad, you know? Trading is a tough game isn't it? No mercy.\n\nSo that’s where I'm going to hold a little past open and then I’m cashing in big-time, and he’s gonna be selling plasma to cover his losses. What would you guys do? Do I come clean, or let him find out the hard way? Either way, I’m buying a steak dinner tomorrow. Maybe I’ll even let him smell it. Also a hooker.",

        "content": "Let's face it, $SNOW has been one of the most disappointing-performing stocks of the year. While $NVDA is riding the AI wave, and $MSTR is riding the BTC boom, $SNOW has been sitting here like a fat child eating cake and shitting himself in the process.\n\nBut this is all about to change, and let's discuss why:\n\n1. Winter is coming, and people will associate $SNOW with warm fuzzy feelings while drinking hot cocoa by the fireplace. This is inherently bullish.\n2. $SNOW has historically always beaten revenue estimates (bullish), and 88% of the time it beats EPS estimates. I expect this time to be no different (beat both revenue and EPS), however this is never enough to rally this stock (more below).\n3. $SNOW has been hiring like crazy. I know because I've applied twice so far and been rejected both times (smart choice on their part - bullish), which means they're being picky and likely receiving a lot of strong candidates to improve their offering (extra bullish). I've been keeping an eye on all open positions, along with how long they're open for, and new ones that pop up. Everything I've seen indicates a hiring frenzy to expand into more markets, take on new clients, etc.\n4. $SNOW tends to retain their customers and strengthen existing relationships. Just today they announced a stronger partnership with $MSFT by releasing a new platform to work with $MSFT Power Platform (bullish AF)\n5. In May, $SNOW appointed Sridhar Ramaswamy as the new CEO, who is expected to focus on enhancing the company's AI (bullish) product strategy.\n6. Going off the point above, the actual real-world numbers of customers using their AI product is genuinely exploding, and we all know how bullish AI is in today's market. \n\n**Q**: Ok, but why is THIS time different than all the other earnings reports when $SNOW crashed and burned?\n\n**A**: Like I said in Point 2 above, we Snowflakians always beat revenue and EPS predictions, but for some reason the stock always goes down. The reason behind this - as is the consensus of analysts - is that investors are cautious against how much money $SNOW is pouring into their products, R&D, and operating costs. This quarter we should start to actually see the results of these investments, returning strong usage statistics and a healthy increase in overall adoption from the industry.\n\n**Q**: Ok, but what about, like, Databricks and stuff?\n\n**A**: Databricks can suck my nuts (they also haven't hired me yet - I'm trying to get in before they go public for those sweet stock gainz)\n\n**My Positions** (Screenshot below):\n\n200 Shares $SNOW @ $127.95\n\n10x 128C Exp 12/06/24 @ $8.36\n\n5x 160C Exp 06/20/25 @ $10.47\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t40qeg1d5x1e1.jpg?width=1226&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=983664d9a5f3edd36636d54711c56d8d63a75620\n\nThis is not financial advice.

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1gusfdx/wallstreet_forecasts_normal_year_for_stocks_in/",
        "content": "According to yahoo finance [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-forecasts-normal-year-for-stocks-in-2025-after-historic-rally-182124444.html) and [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/goldman-sachs-forecasts-p-500-054053974.html) several big financial institutions see the S&P moderating to a \"normal\" growth rate with the hype over AI starting to wane and a likely transition into other sectors. These are very reasonable assessments, if you make your prognosis on the base of efficient market behaviour.\n\nSo why would some rando - yours truly - troll these halls of wisdom with a random theory of what is going to happen? The answer is simple: That is what we do on WSB. Also, I have bullet points:\n\n  \n1st: The efficient market is dead. After the election massive amounts of retail investors have swept into the stock market and cryptocurrencies. According to [some video I saw on the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P03PfYgNjmw&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63B2lDhyKOsImI7FjCf6eDW&index=20) when large amounts of retail investors get into the market, the \"efficiency\" suffers, meaning, the market does not find the right prices for equities and beins to overprice them.\n\n  \n2nd. According to [another video on the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5PF2PcElV0&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63B2lDhyKOsImI7FjCf6eDW&index=19) (just coincidentally from the same \"youtuber\") the human brain is evolutionary not equipped, to stop greeding after more profit, once it started seeing progress. This is true for professional investors and even much more so for significantly less sophisticated individuals without the saftey net of a risk desk. This means the people, who stream into the stock market and cryptocurrencies right now, will not stop driving the prices up.\n\n  \n3rd. I´ve done my own research (watching those videos on the internet) and it says, that only two options stop us in those tracks: Learning through losses to take less risk and price more realistically or going broke. I find \"my research\" heavily supported in this subreddit.\n\n  \n4th. Market efficiency will further erode by currently unpredictable effects of an unknown, but likely rather disrupting policy. This will cause for some investors the pain, necessary to adapt or leave the market, for others it will cause massive gains, which will draw even more less sophistcated traders in.\n\n  \n5th. Given the limited sophistication, these investors are likely to focus on a limited range of assets, which are well represented in the media: AI and cryptocurrencies. This will lead to a continuing strong and overperforming bull run, drawing other investments up in it´s wake, but only on a limited scale.\n\n  \n6th. Companies will use this opportunity to launch extremely well doing IPOs.\n\n  \n7th. This bull run will end in a crash, because - according to my research on the internet and a couple of decades watching the hoax establishment news - it always does. Keep in mind, that this event does not necessarily have to happen in 2025.\n\n  \n8th. That market crash will wipe out massive amounts of wealth, ruin existences and make other filthy, filthy rich. Usually the latter are those, who were already filthy, filthy rich before. Unsophisticated investors will leave the market or be forced to leave and the markets become significantly more efficient again.\n\n  \n7th. Doing my own research means, I have to put foward conclusions. I weighed mine at least for several minutes while writing this text, so they are highly reliable predictions, but I still warn anybody from mistaking them for financial advice or antyhing else than demigodly prohecies:\n\n  \n\\- The crash of the stock market will not lead to an extinction event, but a selection event. While companies will get wiped out, those, which survive will dominate the stock market just like the mag7 now, which are basically the survivors of the dotcom crash.\n\n  \n\\- The crash of the cryptocurrency market will lead to an extinction event. It will wipe out most of cypto investors and funds/ETFs. This is due to the simple fact, that the market is way to much of a single economic niche. After that it may recover up to a point.\n\n  \ntl;dr: The efficient market is dead - long live the goldrush.",

Also $NVDA ER is tomorrow  \n\\- Valuation: They trade at a 81.86 PE ratio \n\n# S&P 500 Inclusion\n\nThe S&P 500 index rebalancing occurs 4x/year with the next one coming up. [SP Global](https://www.spglobal.com/en) announces the additions to the index which will replace companies that have underperformed and will be removed.\n\nS&P rebalancing presents an opportunity to trade based on predictions of which companies will be added/removed as there is potential for a \\~5-10% price increase. In short, the rebalance forces institutions who follow certain indexes to buy the stock as it is now in the index & generally there is a positive impact on company's reputation.\n\nAlthough the selection committee has requirements for eligibility which can be found here: [SP 500 Criteria](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-indices.pdf), there is a bit of thematic flexibility. By definition the index is \"a market cap-weighted index of US large- and mid-cap stocks.\" Typically companies need to be $18B or larger in market cap and historically profitable. Negative trailing EPS, high volatility, recent IPO, etc. may restrict a stock from eligibility.\n\nBelow is the **SP 500 index sector weighting** (as of Nov 14):  \nTechnology: 33.32% | Financial Services: 13.19% | Consumer Cyclical: 10.80% |.

A great example of this is Palantir ($PLTR) which btw pumped like 10% off of the news. Now I know r/wallstreetbets has a love/hate relationship with $PLTR but put that aside for now (it was added to the index around $35)\n\n**Rebalance Timeline**: [Q4 2024 ](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/ICE_NYSE_2024_Yearly_Trading_Calendar.pdf)  \n\\*based on the usual schedule, check the website for official announcements\n\n* Quarter End Date: Dec 31\n* Announcement Date: Early December (typically 1st week)\n* Rebalance Date: Dec 20 (typically 3rd Friday)\n\n# Closing Note\n\nI will be waiting until after NVIDIA reports earnings on 11/20 to make any adjustments to this trade or to rethink my thesis. Would recommend this especially if you do not already have a position in $VRT. I could be completely wrong. God speed!\n\n\nPOST NVIDIA ER UPDATE (Edit 11/21)\n- $NVDA great earnings, beat expectations, and currently trading green in the pre market\n- $VRT might not pull back at all since the momentum is continuing and they literally talked about the need for data centers and cooling solutions on the ER\n- IF and that’s an IF we pull back, look for the $127/$130 level to buy in\n",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gv31pp/gigacloud_gct_buying_when_nobody_wants_it/",
        "content": "**TL;DR:** I believe [GigaCloud](https://www.gigacloudtech.com/)'s stock will experience a price rally driven by strong fundamentals and its current undervaluation. I'm bullish on its business model, economic potential, and attractive pricing. I’m not expecting a 5x or 10x rally, but I do think a 2x gain is reasonable with a solid margin of safety. A DCF analysis indicates a fair price of $40. From a technical perspective, the company has delivered solid earnings growth quarter after quarter and has had years to consolidate, forming a large cup pattern.\n\nI’m holding 105 LEAPS for '26 and '27. This stock could potentially double, or it could drop to zero. Take it with a huge grain of salt. All information shared here is purely my opinion and should not be considered as advice. I’ve lost money, except for IonQ where I got lucky.\n\n# Introduction\n\n**Company:** GigaCloud Technology  \n**Ticker:** $GTC  \n**Industry:** Online Merchandise/E-Commerce Platforms  \n**Price:** $22.96\n\nOver the past few days, I’ve been diving deep into a small, sub-$1B market cap company, and after reviewing various opinions on $GTC online, I wanted to share my own thoughts.\n\nThe company has faced two short reports from [Grizzly](https://grizzlyreports.com/gigacloud-technology-inc-another-china-hustle-inflating-key-metrics-using-undisclosed-related-party-shell-companies/) and [Culper Research](https://x.com/CulperResearch/status/1707392689367347709), alleging that GigaCloud inflates its numbers using shell companies, reports costs as revenue, and falsifies addresses in official documents. While this is mostly boring stuff, it’s certainly had an impact, with the stock dropping by 50% since the reports were released. The company did [respond](https://investors.gigacloudtech.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gigacloud-technology-inc-responds-short-seller-report-0) to the allegations, and has requested to dismiss the class action filed by investors.\n\nAfter conducting my own research, I have a different view. I see signs of a potential compounder in the making, and I believe the current valuation makes it a worthwhile bet. I won’t go into too much detail here, as that would be boring to read, but I’ll keep it brief. This isn’t meant to be a detailed thesis, just a quick summary of the key points behind my bullish outlook.\n\nYou can find all the relevant information in the company’s annual report, the CEO [interview](https://x.com/CulperResearch/status/1707392689367347709) on Seeking Alpha, and several third-party articles. I have more insights to share, but it would be too long to write it out in a single post.\n\nThere’s also some speculation about $GCT following a similar technical pattern to Amazon after its IPO, and I won’t dive into that here, as it’s a bit far-fetched. What’s more interesting to me is the comparison between Amazon’s [early days](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/28/a-look-back-at-amazons-1997-ipo/) in the fragmented book market and Giga’s furniture business. Both industries were large and fragmented when these companies started, with a chance to take a lot of market share, and that’s a key factor in my outlook on $GTC’s potential.\n\n# Operations\n\nThe company operates a platform called [GigaB2B](https://www.gigab2b.com/), where it connects businesses with products manufactured in industrial countries like China, Vietnam, India, etc. While selling products itself isn't particularly flashy, the strength of GigaCloud's model lies in the value it provides beyond simple merchandising. This platform doesn't rely on the typical low margins associated with standard product sales.\n\nGigaB2B connects large businesses: the sellers are manufacturers, and the buyers are companies looking to sell inventory to their own customers. What sets the platform apart is its ability to meet the needs of foreign businesses that lack affordable ways to directly reach their target customers, and U.S. buyers looking to trade these essential products. By consolidating this process into one channel, GigaCloud effectively simplifies international trade and logistics for businesses that might otherwise struggle to connect.\n\nMany of the visits occur through API connections, as GigaCloud functions as a digital warehouse, payment system, and ERP platform, linking their customers' systems directly to their store. Additionally, they offer a [Shopify app](https://apps.shopify.com/giga) to provide further value.\n\nI found this [article](https://www.furnituretoday.com/opinion/the-inventory-problem-how-e-commerce-thrives-where-brick-and-mortar-struggles-guest-contributor/) incredibly helpful to understand the business.\n\n# Tariffs and Bad market\n\nThe company specializes in selling furniture, and while the housing market is currently in a challenging position, this sentiment is already reflected in the stock price. However, I believe that despite the bleak outlook for housing, consumers might still experience some relief as central banks globally look to implement quantitative easing by lowering interest rates. As sad as it may sound, even though home buyers may not be able to move, people may still have more disposable income to spend. With this extra cash, rather than moving to a new home, many could choose to invest in improving their current living space by purchasing more home goods.\n\nRegarding tariffs, I'm not overly concerned. I believe the negative implications of tariffs are already priced into the stock, based on the assumption that tariffs will severely hurt companies and overshadow their profits. The new rules and tariffs primarily affect drop-shippers from China to the U.S., where there’s no middleman involved, just direct shipping of small items from platforms like Temu or Alibaba. However, since GigaCloud operates its own warehouses in the U.S. and Europe, it functions as both the buyer and seller, insulating itself from the negative effects of tariffs on drop-shipped goods.\n\nWe’ll have to wait for more stability to understand the concrete changes, but I think the negative effects of these factors have been significantly overblown, and that they will turn out to be much ado about nothing for this stock. Of course, I could be proven wrong. I'm not a tax expert, but the company's outlook remains bullish, as they continue to demonstrate confidence in their ability to grow and expand despite macroeconomic challenges, as highlighted in their recent earnings calls.\n\n# Catalysts\n\nThe acquisition of [Noble House](https://noblehousefurniture.com/), a smaller U.S. furniture company, is expected to break even by the end of 2024, with financial benefits becoming apparent in the first two quarters of 2025. Noble House brings thousands of SKUs to the platform, contributing to the company’s growing sales and expanding its market share.\n\nGiven the current political climate, with an incoming administration focused on deregulation and the potential for increased market confidence through lower interest rates, M&A activity is anticipated to surge in the coming year. In a fragmented industry with significant market share still up for grabs, each incremental acquisition, like Noble House (if proven to be accretive), could boost revenue and increase the platform's overall value.\n\nMoreover, with the company holding relatively substantial cash reserves, it is in a strong position to pursue further [acquisitions](https://www.furnituretoday.com/financial/acquistion-complete-gigacloud-finalizes-85-million-deal-for-furniture-maker-and-retailer/), which could accelerate its growth trajectory. This makes it well-positioned to capitalize on an environment ripe for consolidation.\n\n# The Street's view\n\nWhile many bear reports focus on claims that the company is outwardly 'fake', alleging that its numbers, employees, and balance sheet are fabricated, few of these critiques dive into the operational side. They rarely discuss why the business model could stagnate in the coming years or how increased competition might adversely affect GigaCloud.\n\nOn the other hand, bulls tend to align with the company's outlook, focusing on current data. They highlight the company's relatively 'cheap' valuation, as indicated by a low PE ratio and price-to-enterprise value, while also emphasizing the expected growth rate as the basis for their bullish thesis. This perspective often isolates GigaCloud within its current ecosystem of partners and the furniture market it serves.\n\nHowever, I take a different approach. When analyzing GCT, I base my thesis on management’s past actions and their long-term vision. Similar to how Costco and Amazon started with small operations, building up one warehouse at a time and selling limited goods, GigaCloud may follow a similar path. These companies benefited from economies of scale as they grew, and I believe GigaCloud has the potential to do the same. By focusing on niche markets, particularly large and 'bulky' goods that many competitors avoid due to logistical complexities, the company is tapping into a profitable, under-exploited area. With growth, this core competency could enable GigaCloud to achieve scaled economies and strengthen its market position.\n\n# Scaled economies\n\nThe potential for [scaled economies ](https://www.incrementaleconomics.com/scale-economies-shared/)is incredibly valuable, as it not only reduces costs and improves unit economics but also expands margins, making the company more attractive to investors. This, in turn, could lead to higher valuations, particularly through more bullish discounted cash flow models due to the retention of cash. However, what's even more significant is how these savings and accumulated cash could be passed along to customers, or \"users\", on the platform. This is a key factor behind Costco's success, where they leverage bulk products and membership fees to earn revenue, or Amazon's ability to offer competitive prices on its platform.\n\nFor GigaCloud, now focused on the furniture sector, the resulting lower unit economics could be passed on to partners, enhancing the platform's appeal. By offering better value to their customers, GigaCloud can potentially strengthen the overall ecosystem, by passing on the cost benefits.\n\nAs of the previous quarter’s presentation, the company has reached a significant milestone with 1,051 active sellers, manufacturers based in various countries, and 8,535 buyers, who purchase bulk goods at B2B prices and then mark them up for sale in markets like the U.S. and Europe.\n\n# AI Story\n\nComing from Palantir at the start of this year, to IonQ, and now Giga, the tech seems to deteriorate in the fastest fashion. However, while Giga is not a \"tech\" company in the traditional sense, the views on AI and Giga, especially from Wall Street, strike me as pretty amusing.\n\nBears focus on the platform’s chat capabilities and argue that Giga lacks AI features. I don’t think chat is that important, and LLMs would be better used for back-end logistics. Giga might not have the most advanced models or software stack, but they use what they have well for their industry. The company handles a lot of goods and, through their software and existing logistics systems, calculates the most efficient way to send them from other countries.\n\nManagement talks about AI, but not in the same way S&P 500 CEOs do. The tech’s been around for over 30 years, and a lot of companies have been quietly using it in the back end for things like pricing and routes. I get the bear argument that Giga’s trying to piggyback on the AI trend, but I disagree. The company’s been using those systems behind the scenes long before the current AI hype became mainstream and was used by every CEO.\n\n# Technicals\n\nGigaCloud's current P/E ratio stands at 6.9, which is notably low for a company with growing revenue and an expanding user base, in my opinion.\n\nThe most important fact is that [Cramer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4Au0PfFbc0) has raised concerns about the company and published a bearish video on it six months ago.\n\n# Closing Remarks\n\nAs mentioned earlier, many influential voices are bearish on the stock, citing concerns such as tariffs, potential China-related scams, and weakening consumer demand. However, I tend to buy when sentiment is negative, as long as the short-term fundamentals remain solid. While there's always the possibility that things could go wrong, I've incorporated this risk into my overall risk/reward analysis.",

In a sense, it was a protest to Windows 11's feature bloat, lack of privacy protections, and lack of innovation. Microsoft has had YEARS to clean up Windows and make it a presentable and modern OS. They continue to disappoint me year after year. Windows is easy to use but looks hideous and lacks customizability. Microsoft's track record with user privacy is also extremely questionable - and their push for more and more AI features like recall has me concerned. \n\nIn addition to that - x86-64 hardware configurations have become far too power hungry for day-to-day use. I have a desktop PC with a 5950x, 64GB of RAM, and a 6900XT. It plays any game I throw on it - at the cost of massive power consumption. Day to day tasks like streaming videos or creative tasks like editing music can easily take 100-300 watts of power or more and generates so much heat. I had to move my computer out of my bedroom just because of how hot it made things in the summer. Graphics cards have gotten massive and Intel CPUs in particular have become so power hungry. When it comes to laptops, both Intel and AMD just aren't competitive with Apple's M series of chips when it comes to performance and battery life. Intel made great strides with Lunar Lake but that is a one-off product that is mostly available in thin-and-light chassis that aren't quite as nice as a MacBook.\n\nWhile the selection of games running natively on ARM Mac's is limited, I've found that a decent amount of games that I want to play can run. Other games can be streamed over Steam Link (even on the go) from a Windows PC at home. Buying a Mac for gaming isn't that huge of a compromise for gamers if you have an existing Windows machine to do the heavy lifting. \n\nOverall, I'm super happy with my new MacBook. I still wouldn't call myself a massive Apple fan - I don't love all their business practices; but I trust them with my data and their mobile hardware is simply too good to be ignored. Maybe if AMD/Intel is able to make mobile chips that compete with Apple's silicon I will switch back to Windows/Linux in the future but time will tell. ",

The thing is, I do notice that sometimes, even 16gb of ram is a bit low. And the 256gb storage is also really low, but I am fine with using an external ssd as long as its not much slower.\n\nI have barely been using my desktop PC I had for about 2 years ever since I got this MacBook, so I will likely end up selling it. I only really use it whenever I need some more memory, or just heavier workloads in general. this got me thinking about my options for what to use for my heavier workloads *after* selling the PC. I expect that if I sell the PC, I will have enough money for a base model mac mini with m4, which seems to be a really good machine. but then I still have 16gb memory limition.\n\nThen I realised I could probably either sell or trade in my macbook air, depending on which ends up more beneficial where I live, and then maybe spend a bit more, to get a macbook pro with m4.\n\nSome more info about what I use my computer for:\n\n*  Programming and general software development workflows (often with compiled languages, which is nice if it happens fast).\n* Light gaming (think minecraft with friends).\n* and the general browsing of the web, keeping notes, etc.\n\nMy question is basically: should I get a base model mac mini, or should I sell my macbook and potentially spend a lot more money on \"one machine for everything\". and if I do end up getting a macbook pro, what upgrades are worth it and which arent, I assume the storage is the least valuable to me, because external storage isnt that expensive.",

I’d appreciate any advice or tips you all might have!\n\nHere’s my current setup:\n\n* **Indicators:** MACD, RSI, and 9/21/50 EMA.\n* **Timeframes:** I use the 1-minute chart for entries while referencing the 5-minute, 15-minute, and even the 1-hour chart for the overall trend.\n* **Supply/Demand Levels:** I chart these religiously and try to use them as key zones for decision-making.\n\nDespite this, I often hesitate to pull the trigger, and when I do, I’ll sell at a loss because the price moves down past my stop loss. I have a hard time trusting the trends I see, even after doing all this analysis. It feels like I’m either entering too early or too late and then cutting myself short before the trade has a chance to play out.\n\nHow do you all manage your entry/exit strategy for SPY 0DTEs, especially in such fast-paced setups? Do you recommend adjusting my stop loss strategy or using different indicators to confirm entries? How do you stay in trades long enough to see profit without second-guessing yourself?\n\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts. Thanks in advance!",

Today, so far blasting thru after basing under it for a while. Here's the thing, when the price is touching that line on the 1hr chart, it isn't on the daily chart. When it eventually touched it on the daily chart, price has already blasted through it on the 1hr chart.

        "content": " https://www.reddit.com/r/AAPL/s/ikueXK1qG6\n\nI posted recently about selling my AAPL allocation, and it honestly provided a lot of great context and feedback into why AAPL is still a great stock to hold. Really valued the opinions there. \n\nSo for now, I’m keeping the majority of my AAPL, but did trim it a little. Sold 10 stocks at $228 to buy GOOG at $179. I think both stocks will go up in the next 5-10 years, but GOOG should be better placed to grow at a better rate\n\nCould be a big mistake, will see what happens in a years time",

        "content": "* Stocks took a hit early on after Russian President Vladimir Putin lowered the threshold for nuclear weapon use, citing U.S. support for Ukraine’s long-range missile strikes. The Dow stayed in the red, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq managed to claw their way back into the green.\n* By the bell, the Dow dipped 0.3%, while the S&P 500 rose 0.4%, boosted by tech strength. Nvidia led the Nasdaq’s recovery, as Wall Street shrugged off nuclear concerns to focus on the day’s winners.\n\n# \n\n# Winners & Losers\n\n# What’s up 📈\n\n* **Super Micro Computer** soared 31.24% after filing a much-delayed financial plan, avoiding a Nasdaq delisting. The company also announced BDO as it s new auditor. ($SMCI)\n* **Symbotic** surged 27.68% following an impressive beat-and-raise quarter, with fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of $576.8 million surpassing analyst estimates. ($SYM)\n* **MicroStrategy** climbed 11.89% as the company announced plans to continue purchasing more bitcoin. ($MSTR)\n* **Insmed** rallied 10% after terminating a $500 million equity sales agreement with Leerink Partners. ($INSM)\n* **Walmart** gained 3% to hit a record high after exceeding fiscal third-quarter earnings expectations and raising its full-year outlook. ($WMT)\n\n# What’s down 📉\n\n* **H&R Block** dropped 8.20%, and Intuit slid 5.10% after reports surfaced that President-elect Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency is exploring a mobile tax filing app. ($HRB, $INTU)\n* **Trump Media & Technology Group** fell 8.88%, continuing its volatile trading pattern following recent speculation of an acquisition of Bakkt. ($DJT)\n* **Incyte** tumbled 8.33% after pausing the Phase 2 trial of its new spontaneous hives treatment. ($INCY)\n* **Lowe’s** slid 4.60% after providing weak sales guidance for 2024, overshadowing a strong fiscal third-quarter report. ($LOW)\n\n# \n\n# Walmart Raises Outlook on Strong Spending From Value-Seekers\n\nWalmart is sprinkling a little early holiday cheer on Wall Street. \n\nThe retail giant reported stronger-than-expected sales, raised its annual outlook, and sent its stock to an all-time high. Adjusted earnings hit $0.58 per share, beating analyst forecasts of $0.53, while revenue soared 5% year over year to $169.59 billion, easily outpacing expectations.\n\n**High-Income Shoppers, Bigger Baskets**  \n  \nInterestingly, it wasn’t just budget-conscious shoppers driving Walmart’s gains. High-income households, making over $100,000 annually, accounted for 75% of the quarter’s share growth. \n\nShoppers were also spending more per trip, with the average ticket size increasing by 2.1%. And while discretionary items like toys and home goods finally showed some growth, groceries remain Walmart’s bread and butter.\n\n**E-Commerce Is a Bright Spot:** Walmart’s online presence continues to shine, with e-commerce sales climbing 22%. Customers aren’t just shopping online—they’re paying extra for speedier deliveries, with 30% of orders now including a premium fee. \n\nWalmart’s digital strategy, bolstered by curbside pickups and its expanding third-party marketplace, is inching closer to profitability.\n\n**Tariffs, Weather, and the Road Ahead:** Despite the holiday buzz, storm clouds loom. President-elect Trump’s proposed tariffs could push prices higher, potentially testing Walmart’s \"everyday low prices\" mantra. Warm weather has also dampened demand for seasonal items like clothing and heaters.\n\nStill, Walmart’s diversified sourcing strategy and ability to attract high-income customers may help it weather these challenges, leaving competitors trailing as the retail giant marches into the holiday season with confidence.\n\n# \n\n# Market Movements\n\n* ✈️ **Boeing Slashes Over 2,500 U.S. Jobs:** Boeing announced layoffs impacting technicians, engineers, and nonunion workers as part of plans to cut 17,000 positions globally. ($BA)\n* 🌐 **DOJ Pushes for Google Browser Divestiture:** The Department of Justice is seeking to force Google to divest its Chrome browser, citing a search monopoly ruling. Additional measures may include unbundling Android from Google Play and Search. ($GOOGL)\n* 🏀 **NBA Secures $77B Broadcast Deal:** The NBA and Warner Bros. Discovery settled a lawsuit over live game rights, clearing the way for Disney, Comcast, and Amazon to become the league's primary U.S. broadcast partners under a $77B deal. ($DIS, $CMCSA, $AMZN)\n* 💉 **Wegovy Launches in China:** Novo Nordisk's weight-loss drug Wegovy debuted in China at $194 for 4 injections, giving Novo a lead over Eli Lilly, whose Zepbound drug has yet to hit the Chinese market. ($NVO)\n* 🩺 **Eli Lilly's Cholesterol Pill Shows Promise:** Eli Lilly's experimental oral drug reduced a genetic form of high cholesterol by up to 86% in a mid-stage trial, marking it as the only oral treatment currently under testing. ($LLY)\n* 🥕 **Organic Carrots Recalled Over E. coli Outbreak:** Organic and baby carrots from Grimmway Farms, sold at retailers like Whole Foods, Target, and Walmart, have been recalled following an E. coli outbreak linked to 39 illnesses, 15 hospitalizations, and 1 death. ($AMZN, $TGT, $WMT)\n* 🤖 **AI Startup d-Matrix Unveils First Chip:** Chipmaker startup d-Matrix, backed by Microsoft, launched its first AI chip targeting chatbots and video generation. The company noted that Super Micro's servers are compatible with the chip. ($MSFT, $SMCI)\n* 📈 **Super Micro Hires Auditor Amid Accounting Probe:** Super Micro Computer skyrocketed 37% after hiring BDO as its new auditor, addressing delayed SEC filings and a probe into its accounting practices. The company aims to submit required reports soon to maintain its Nasdaq listing. ($SMCI)\n\n# \n\n# Qualcomm Expects to Make $22 Billion by 2029 From Expansion Bid\n\nQualcomm is dialing up its ambitions. \n\nThe chipmaker announced that it expects $22 billion in additional annual revenue by 2029, fueled by expansions into PCs, automotive, and industrial applications. CEO Cristiano Amon’s strategy to diversify beyond smartphone chips, which still account for 75% of Qualcomm’s sales, seems to be gaining traction.\n\n**PCs, Cars, and Everything Else**  \n  \nQualcomm projects $4 billion in annual revenue from PC chips by 2029, a significant move into a market dominated by Intel. Automotive chips are expected to contribute $8 billion annually, a 175% increase from current levels, with 80% of that tied to existing contracts.\n\nOther promising segments include industrial chips ($4 billion) and headsets ($2 billion). The company is also targeting opportunities in wireless headphones, tablets, and more.\n\n**The Apple Problem and AI Opportunity**  \n  \nWhile Qualcomm is spreading its wings, it faces headwinds. Apple, a major customer, could cut ties as early as 2027, impacting modem sales. But Qualcomm’s focus on “edge AI”—bringing advanced AI capabilities to devices rather than relying on cloud computing—offers a potential lifeline. \n\nExecutives suggested that chips running on smartphones today could soon handle tasks previously reserved for massive server farms.\n\n**The Big Picture:** Qualcomm’s push to reduce reliance on smartphones is a response to shifting industry dynamics, like Apple’s in-house chip efforts and the growing demand for diversified tech solutions. With a total addressable market estimated at $900 billion by 2030, Qualcomm’s roadmap appears ambitious but calculated. \n\nHowever, with competition heating up in PCs and automotive, execution will be key to achieving these lofty goals.\n\n# \n\n# On The Horizon\n\n# Tomorrow\n\nNo major economic data is dropping tomorrow, but keep an ear out for a few Federal Reserve governors speaking at various events—including Michelle Bowman, a name you might remember.\n\nBowman made headlines back in September as the lone dissenter when the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points, marking the first time in 20 years a Fed governor broke from the pack on a monetary policy decision. Talk about standing out.\n\nThough she sided with the crew this month on a 25-basis-point cut, Bowman’s willingness to go against the grain makes her remarks tomorrow something to watch.\n\n# Before Market Open: \n\n* **Target** may be a household favorite, but even fan favorites feel the squeeze. Earlier this year, the retailer slashed prices on thousands of products to entice budget-conscious shoppers—and they’re gearing up to do it again for the holiday season. Despite the markdown marathon, Target’s bottom line has stayed relatively steady, and analysts expect the previous quarter to hold up well. Still, shareholders are likely asking the big question: When does the discounting spree end? For now, the consensus calls for $2.30 EPS on $25.96 billion in revenue. ($TGT)\n\n# After Market Close: \n\n* **Nvidia** continues to play the MVP role in the stock market. Its Magnificent 7 counterparts delivered solid earnings this quarter, and all eyes are on whether the chip titan—up nearly 190% this year—has more fuel in the tank. For those fearing they’re late to the AI boom, analysts are betting there’s plenty of runway left. With AI demand showing no signs of cooling, Nvidia remains the undisputed king of the semiconductor hill. Consensus estimates peg earnings at $0.74 per share on $32.86 billion in revenue. ($NVDA)",

        "content": "To politely save your time and get to the point: I’ve been trading for about a week with extremely small amounts of money (like 1-3 shares) until I can nail down a strategy that works for me. I have done months of preparation, studying, note taking, and even have my notes sitting in front of me when I open the computer to begin trading. I have a Google Doc where I debrief every day of trading and my debrief points are almost always the freaking same-\n\n1) I feel like I’m just randomly jumping into the stock and HOPING to see a green candle next. Holy hell it’s so frustrating.  \n2) It’s like the chart WAITS for me to click the buy button so it can pop up a red candle. “Oh you want to buy? Boom. Red candle. Get fucked”. Every. Single. Time.\n3) I miss all the good moves. I’m watching a stock… it’s not doing anything… so I switch to another.. it’s not doing anything.. so I switch back… boom. Huge green move. Son of a bitch.\n\nI study charts. I see what other traders are doing. I review my notes. I do the technical analysis (MACD, resistance lines, etc). I feel confident. But as soon as I open my computer, it’s a game of free for all. The chart is so unpredictable and when I think it’s going to be a green candle it’s a red and vice versa. MY QUESTION IS: Does this get better with time and experience? I’ve played sports and I fly airplanes for a living. You can’t get good at those overnight and I suppose the same is with trading. I just can’t believe after all the prep work I’ve done, I still feel like an idiot when I open my laptop and begin a trade. \n\nDetails: I mainly trade from 7am-10am. I use 10sec and 1min charts, 1min being the primary. I have an extremely filtered screener so I only get stocks that fit my criteria that another HIGHLY successful trader uses. ",
