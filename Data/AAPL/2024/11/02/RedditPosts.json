        "content": "Etsy reported a 6% decline in gross merchandising sales in the third quarter. Active buyers decreased as well as habitual buyers.\n\nI can tell you one of the reasons why (a contributing factor). I have been a buyer on Etsy since 2016. I am also a seller. I cannot purchase multiple items on Etsy say more than 10 items at a time because of Etsy's faulty cart. This has been the case for at least a couple of years. I first started having the problem in my main shop a couple of years ago.\n\nI buy a lot of jewelry supplies so I can easily purchase many items at once and have. I am a habitual buyer who has probably spent approximately $40k maybe more on Etsy all these years.\n\nI started using a second account to purchase because the constant popups in the shop I sell on are too annoying. Many sellers/buyers report the same. Etsy does not care.\n\nAnyway, in my second account I have been trying to add items to my cart (all beads) to purchase from this one shop. I would have bought from them elsewhere if they had their own site but they do not.\n\nLast Sunday I spent a couple of hours looking through the shops over 2000 listings. They have awesome beads and shopping is fun for me. The first time around that is. Thereafter, it is no longer fun and now like work. I added the items on Sunday. I came back on Monday to purchase and I could not access my cart. I contact support who said I would get an email. I did not. I contacted them the next day and asked if they were going to fix my cart. They told me they thought it was a problem with 14 items in the saved for later. I specifically told Etsy support DO NOT remove the 97 items in my cart, but you could the saved for later.\n\nThe next day to my surprise the cart was fixed. But Etsy removed those 97 items in my cart that I wanted to buy! That was time consuming. The problem is that some buyers are not able to add more than 10 items in their cart at a time to purchase, but the cart allows up to 100. I was upset. Support gave me a $20 credit for the inconvenience.\n\nAs it is now like work for me and not fun I go to add the items back in my cart and it is quite time consuming. I did make two purchases earlier today but they were not more than 5 items. I figured I could add up to not more than 40 items and be good. At 38 items my cart glitched out and I cannot access the cart!\n\nI contact support again tonight and told them this. Support was able to get the items down to 20 in my cart to where it works. So it seems I can safely purchase 20 items. But I will have to do a multiple item purchase for all I want to buy. Support gave me another $10 credit. They claim Etsy is trying to fix this problem for buyers.\n\nMost buyers would not persist as I have. Most buyers would move on elsewhere to Amazon, Ebay, etc. And most probably do.\n\nSellers are losing out on sales and so is Etsy because Etsy is incapable of fixing this cart issue. They don't care.\n\nFor 5 days I have tried to purchase a large amount of beads from this one shop and still trying! I have written the COO twice this past week. I probably wrote management a couple of years ago when it happened. They know about it.\n\nI have been buying on Amazon as a prime member for several years. I have been buying on Ebay since 2016. I have NEVER experienced a glitch or malfunction on those marketplaces ever! It is always a seamless experience as a buyer and seller. Etsy has daily glitches and malfunctions. If Amazon and Ebay can do it why can't Etsy?\n\nAnd accessing support as a buyer and seller is quite difficult. I can imagine the average buyer is not going to take the time to try to get through the maze to access support thus they abandon Etsy.\n\nI can imagine how much manpower and $ Etsy has spent fixing buyers cart issues and credits they are issuing. Rather than just fixing the problem once and for all so the cart functions normally and seamlessly.\n\nDon't even get me started on seller's pain points, there are many of them as well.\n\nThe moral of this story is do you want to invest in a company that can't have a functioning cart and treats their buyers and sellers like they do? They don't care obviously that they are losing sales since this has gone on for a long, long time.\n\nEtsy are you listening? No they are not. Elliot management are you listening? Analysts are you listening? Investors are you listening?",

Is GSAT a buy after the 40% rise in share price?.\n\nHere is some information I have , but is there anything I should be aware of ? \n\nThe expanded partnership between Globalstar (GSAT) and Apple (APL) could bring significant long-  term benefits to Globalstar's stock, though some challenges may stil lie ahead.  \nPotential Positive Impacts  I. Revenue Growth: With Apple prepaying up to $1.1 billion and committing to pay additional  service fees, Globalstar can expect substantial revenue growth. The agreement is projected to  more than double Globalstar's annual revenue compared to 2024 levels, primarily driven by the  new satellite network's capacity and performance milestones  2. Market Confidence: Apple's involvement and the substantial upfront payments provide market  validation for Globalstar, boosting investor confidence. A stronger association with Apple, along  with its 20% equity stake in Globalstar's satellite network, reinforces the viability and demand for  satellite-enabled connectivity, especially in remote and underserved areas\n3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  C  industries (e.g., maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple cOwews  \nPotential Risks  \n1. High Dependency on Apple: The partners. p heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to zero.\n3. Future Expansion Opportunities: The network's design and expanded ground infrastructure  allow Globalstar to potentially explore new revenue streams, including other high-reliability  industries (e.g. maritime or government sectors), beyond its arrangement with Apple.\nPotential Risks  \n1. High Dependency on Apple: The partnership heavily ties Globalstar's growth trajectory to  Apple's needs and future directions. If Apple shifts its strategic focus away from satellite  communication, Globalstar's revenue and stock could be negatively affected,  \n2. Execution Risks: Globalstar must deliver the new MSS network according to Apple's  performance milestones. Failing to meet these milestones could result in reduced or delayed  payments, which would likely impact the stock negatively.\nIn the near term, Globalstar's stock may experience heightened volatility, as its year-to-date  performance has already been variable. However, if Globalstar manages this partnership successfully.  it could see sustained growth, especially as satelite connectivity becomes increasingly relevant to  tech giants like Apple.\n",

However it is being sold at **$25,000 to $30,000** each!\n\nThat's almost 800%-900% profit margins that has to be paid by the companies above, when they opt not to choose In-House Silicon.\n\nAs more of the AI CapEx goes to custom silicon (will never be 100%, but expect that percentage only to grow larger over time, driven by cost savings)  TSMC and Intel foundries will benefit directly from this trend (both have EUV capabilities, INTC will mass produce 18A EUV chips next year, with Amazon as first client)\n\nAnd this will position TSMC and INTC for substantial growth, because **the rate limiting factor for AI growth will be how much silicon can TSMC or INTC manufacture** for the entire world's AI demand.  \n  \n\n\n\n\n",

Will Centrus Energy be able to stay relevant coming years when new technologies enter the scene? \n\nTerm sheet say Terrapower will likely pay for the construction of a HALEU enrichment plant. HALEU is the fuel every small modular reactor needs to operate.\n\nI'm guessing huge gains from nano nuclear, oklo, Nuscale etc gonna come ASPIs way. Small Modular Reactors are like cars and cars don't run without gasoline, SMRs don't run without #HALEU. Who's making the biggest bags of money?

Cheers to u/pennycheck at X for this delicious slice of ASPIe\n\n1. Proprietary Aerodynamic Separation Process (ASP) and Quantum Enrichment technologies for isotope enrichment.\n2. Contracts for Carbon-14, Molybdenum-100, and Silicon-28 production, with potential revenues of $12-30 million in 2024.\n3. Entering the High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) market, with estimated demand over 600 MT by 2035.\n4. Quantum Enrichment method for uranium expected to be more cost-effective and scalable than competitors' technologies.\n5. Signed MOUs with two US-based Small Modular Reactor (SMR) companies to supply HALEU.\n6. Received interest from potential customers totaling over $30 billion of HALEU demand at recent market prices.\n7. Technology allows for HALEU production in a single step, potentially more efficient than competitors.\n8. Expects to produce commercial quantities of HALEU by 2027, potentially satisfying all anticipated demand from advanced reactors in development.\n9. Market capitalization significantly lower than main competitors despite potentially superior technology.\n10. Strong management team with extensive experience in isotope enrichment and finance.\n11. 100% employee retention, helping maintain trade secrets and technological advantages.\n12. Exploring enrichment of depleted uranium tails, potentially leading to higher margins and lower HALEU prices.\n13. Building facilities in Iceland to capitalize on lower electricity costs, potentially improving profitability.\n14. Joint venture with PET Labs, allowing entry into the radioisotope market for nuclear medicine.\n15. Technology is modular and scalable, allowing for rapid capacity expansion.\n16. Significant insider ownership, with management continuing to buy shares.\n17. Targeting multiple markets beyond HALEU, including medical isotopes, silicon for quantum computing, and other industrial applications.\n18. Favorable market environment due to global push for nuclear energy, including pledge to triple nuclear capacity by 2050 at COP28.\n19. Technology could potentially address the HALEU supply bottleneck currently delaying some SMR projects.\n20. Potential ability to produce Weapons Grade Uranium (WGU) could lead to additional government contracts.\n21. Isotope production extends beyond HALEU, with applications for semiconductors and AI companies.\n22. Ytterbium plant commissioned 9 months ahead of schedule, demonstrating efficient execution.\n23. Early completion of Ytterbium plant proves Quantum Enrichment technology, applicable to uranium enrichment for HALEU production.\n24. Ability to recycle depleted uranium tails makes it attractive for governments wanting to avoid new uranium mining operations.\n25. Diverse isotope portfolio makes it relevant to multiple industries and companies.\n26. Major tech companies like Amazon and Google investing heavily in nuclear energy projects, likely increasing demand for HALEU fuel.\n27. Amazon signed agreements to support development of nuclear energy projects, including new SMRs.\n28. Google signed world's first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy from multiple SMRs.\n29. Tech giants' involvement could accelerate SMR development and adoption, creating larger market for ASPI's HALEU production.\n30. Tech companies cite need for reliable, carbon-free energy to power data centers and AI technologies.\n31. US Department of Energy estimates significant job growth in the nuclear industry.\n32. International Energy Agency's report supports long-term prospects for nuclear energy.\n33. Growing corporate interest in nuclear energy could lead to increased investment in the sector.\n34. Successfully enriched Ytterbium-176 using Quantum Enrichment technology.\n35. Commissioning phase of Ytterbium-176 facility completed in 6 weeks instead of expected 3-6 months.\n36. Expects to achieve 99.75% enrichment for Ytterbium-176 and offer it for commercial sale in 2025.\n37. Plans to construct Nickel-64 and Lithium-6/7 Quantum Enrichment plants with production targeted for 2025.\n38. Potentially the only Western supplier of commercial quantities of Ytterbium-176 and similar isotopes.\n39. Quantum Enrichment process believed to be more efficient, scalable, and environmentally friendly than other technologies.\n40. In discussions with potential customers for HALEU requirements valued at over $37 billion.\n41. MOUs with two US-based SMR companies include potential capital investments into HALEU facilities.\n42. Accelerating plans for Nickel-64 and Lithium-6/7 plants due to urgent demand from Western-based producers.\n43. Positioning to meet emerging demand for Lithium-6 in nuclear fusion power plants.\n44. Recruited Lt. Col. William Eden, MBE to lead nuclear strategy in the United Kingdom.\n45. Bill Gates took the first slice of the pie. Bet there's many more wanting a seat at the table.\n46. 24% shorted 10 million shares since $2.90-$8\n\nI'm suspecting ASPI and Gates been discussing silicon-28 since it's now clear Terrapower aim to lock up their HALEU production for ten years. All makes sense to me. Lock up the HALEU to fuel SMRs and build datacentres with silicon-28 semiconductors. Aaaand they build SMRs to power their superior datacentres.\n\nMicrosoft enters the chip wars: https://www.forrester.com/blogs/welcome-to-the-chip-wars-microsoft/\n\nThey will spin off their Uranium business to Quantum Leap Energy. Those who got shares in ASPI will get equal amount of shares in the new company QLE. Plus ASPI will always get 10% of QLEs revenue.\n\nThe HALEU plant Bill Gates is paying for and is expected to be non dilutive to shareholders. He will also buy all the HALEU produced there for a ten year period. Gates want to be the global top dog in small modular reactors.\n\nFinancially their balance sheet have never been stronger with about $43 million dollar cash.\n\nThis is just my opinions and guesses, I'm not a financial advisor. I share information about the company for the community to discuss. So this is not investment advice to sell, buy or do anything speculative. ASPI is worth keeping on the watchlist in my opinion. I keep it in my portfolio, I like the stock so I own the stock. Do your due diligence.",

        "content": "Back in late 2020 heard about a startup in the lithium sector that was researching using high tech methods to speed up recovery time, enhance yield AND lowers the production cost$\n\n\n\nAt first I was skeptical because the company was based in Puerto Rico, but then learned that this was done to be \"tax efficient\"  (long story short after doing DD based on the tech, I threw down a bet on EnergyX via a crowdfunding site)\n\n\n\n[https://netcapital.com/companies/energyx](https://netcapital.com/companies/energyx)\n\n\n\nAnyway seem to have something akin to a winning lotto ticket because my basis is $0.81 (with a 3 for 1 AND then a 2 for 1 stock split),...\n\n\n\n[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1830166/000149315223045075/form253g2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1830166/000149315223045075/form253g2.htm)\n\n\n\nand the latest crowdfunding round was $9.50\n\n\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/04/why-energyx-raised-75m-from-small-investors-even-after-taking-vc-money-from-gm-and-others/](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/04/why-energyx-raised-75m-from-small-investors-even-after-taking-vc-money-from-gm-and-others/)\n\n\n\nBecause my original bet on paper grew 10X (in just over 3 years), decided to add to my position in EnergyX when the offering price was at $9.00 per share\n\n\n\nYesterday got an eMail (from DEALMAKER) saying my money was going to be refunded minus a handling fee,... WTF???\n\n\n\n**Hello,**\n\n\n\n**Over the past few months we have reached out to you on several occasions via email and phone in order to assist in completing your investment. At this time your investment is incomplete and we are unable to move forward with your investment approval.**\n\n\n\n**What does this mean for you?**\n\n\n\n**You will be receiving a refund back to your original payment method for your investment, minus the processing fee.**\n\n\n\n[https://energyx.app.dealmaker.tech/invitations/506c-offering/view](https://energyx.app.dealmaker.tech/invitations/506c-offering/view)\n\n\n\nBottom line basically not happy w/ DEALMAKER which takes care of the back office legal paper work for various crowdfunded startups (AND prior to yesterdays eMail, I didn't get any phone calls OR eMails about any problems w/  investment paperwork records in the startup EnergyX)\n\n\n\n[https://www.dealmaker.tech/](https://www.dealmaker.tech/)",
