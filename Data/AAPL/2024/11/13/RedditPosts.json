        "content": "AMD said on Wednesday that it will lay off 4% of its global staff as the longtime computer chipmaker seeks to gain a stronger foothold in the growing artificial intelligence chip space dominated by Nvidia.\n\n*″*As a part of aligning our resources with our largest growth opportunities, we are taking a number of targeted steps that will unfortunately result in reducing our global workforce by approximately 4%,” an AMD representative said in a statement. “We are committed to treating impacted employees with respect and helping them through this transition.”\n\nAMD had 26,000 employees at the end of last year, according to a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.\n\nAMD is the second-biggest producer of graphics processing units, or GPUs, behind Nvidia. The company has said AI represents one of its largest growth opportunities. AMD stock is down 5% in 2024 while Nvidia shares are up 200%, making it the most valuable publicly traded company in the world.\n\nAMD produces powerful AI accelerators for data centers, including the MI300X, which companies such as Meta and Microsoft purchase as an alternative to Nvidia-based systems. But Nvidia dominates the market for powerful AI chips, with over 80% market share, partially because it developed the core software that AI engineers use to develop programs such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nAMD said in October it expects $5 billion in AI chip sales this year, about a fifth of the $25.7 billion in total sales FactSet projects for AMD’s 2024. AMD believes the total market for AI chips will be $500 billion by 2028, but its total sales are currently dwarfed by Nvidia, which FactSet expects to post $125.9 billion in revenue for calendar year 2024.\n\nGPUs were originally developed for gaming, which is lagging at AMD. AMD’s gaming segment is expected to decline 59% in 2024 to $2.57 billion in revenue, according to FactSet.\n\nAMD also makes processor chips for laptops, desktops and servers, competing primarily with Intel. Its share of server CPU sales rose nearly 3% on an annual basis in the third quarter to 34%, according to Mercury Research.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/13/amd-layoffs-company-to-4percent-of-workforce-or-about-1000-employees-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/13/amd-layoffs-company-to-4percent-of-workforce-or-about-1000-employees-.html)",

        "content": "Cisco reported a fourth straight quarter of declining revenue even as results topped analysts’ estimates. The stock slipped about 1% in extended trading.\n\nHere’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:\n\n* **Earnings per share:** 91 cents adjusted vs. 87 cents expected\n* **Revenue:** $13.84 billion vs. $13.77 billion expected\n\nCisco’s revenue dropped 6% in the quarter ended Oct. 26, from $14.7 billion a year earlier, according to a statement. Net income fell to $2.71 billion, or 68 cents per share, from $3.64 billion, or 89 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nNetworking revenue plunged 23% to $6.75 billion, slightly below the $6.8 billion consensus of analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.\n\nSecurity revenue doubled to $2.02 billion, topping the StreetAccount consensus of $1.93 billion. Cisco’s revenue from collaboration was $1.09 billion, a bit below the $1.04 billion consensus estimate.\n\nChuck Robbins, Cisco’s CEO, said on a Wednesday conference call that orders from large-scale clients for artificial intelligence infrastructure exceeded $300 million in the quarter. Server makers such as Dell and HPE have also focused on sales of hardware that can help clients implement generative AI.\n\n“We have earned more design wins and remain confident that we will exceed our target of $1 billion of AI orders this fiscal year from web-scale customers,” Robbins said.\n\nU.S. government agencies have delayed deals with Cisco, rather than scrapping them altogether, Robbins said.\n\nDuring the quarter, Cisco acquired security startups DeepFactor and Robust Intelligence.\n\nCisco lifted its full-year guidance to $3.60 to $3.66 in adjusted earnings per share on $55.3 billion to $56.3 billion in revenue, up from a prior forecast of $3.52 to $3.58 in EPS and $55 billion to $56.2 billion in revenue. Guidance would indicate projected revenue growth of 3.3% at the middle of the range.\n\nAnalysts expected adjusted earnings for the year of $3.58 per share on $55.89 billion in revenue.\n\nAs of Wednesday’s close, Cisco’s stock was up 17% year to date, while the S&P 500 index, is up around 26% over that stretch.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/13/cisco-csco-q1-earnings-report-2025.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/13/cisco-csco-q1-earnings-report-2025.html)",

Then I partially sold 15th May 2023 at 137.19 (split aligned 13.719), 10th of January 2024 at  $355 (split aligned $35.5) and 12th of September 2024 at $442.13 (split aligned $44.231).\n\nI took out already much more than I did put in, but still own a large position of SMCI. Now I'm in the process of changing the rule for a complete selling in my strategy. As you can see in my disclosure I left a lot of money on the table which already made me change the way I take partial gains.\n\nBut let's speak about Supermicro here. What happened:\n\nHindenburg took a short position and published a report about bookkeeping fraud at Supermicro. Then the auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. The company is now behind on the mandatory reports to the SEC two quarters. This weekend is the deadline for a de-listing on the NASDAQ. The stock tanked 82% from the high. According to the actual published numbers (which may be corrected) the stock is now almost as cheap as when I bought it first, even if the value more than quadrupled still after the loss of 82%.\n\nNow, Hindenburg at first only cited ex employees as source. But the resignation of Ernst & Young as auditor was probably an ace in Hindenburgs sleeve. I personally know Ernst & Young, they are not exactly my favorites. Since they published the report there was a mass of bad news published, the exact same analysts that hived Supermicro to the SP500 more or less exactly at the high say now it is junk after that loss.\n\nI was thinking about Apple. In the time it would have been most profitable to buy everybody shouted sell. The stock lost more than once 80% of its market value.\n\nSupermicro owns a lot of very unique patents. Their liquid cooled systems take less time to build and are more modular than any of the other competitors systems, Dell being its main competitor. Even if they reported some orders too early as sale they sell a lot lot more than a few years ago thanks to AI. And they will probably sell a lot more.\n\nI think it is very possible that we cannot trade Supermicro on the Nasdaq next week. An that means it will fall out of the SP500 and the NASDAQ 100, putting a lot of sell pressure on the ETF that mirror those indices. Or, Supermicro presents a new auditor and a plan to deliver the reports to the SEC by this weekend.\n\nIt is probably a binary bet that will be resolved soon. In my opinion the upside (probability to win multiplied with amount to win) is much higher than the downside (probability to lose multiplied with amount to lose). And even if it is delisted, it is far away from being worthless. Probably it will be a target for Dell.\n\nHere a [chart of Apple](https://www.tradingview.com/x/SDXjHW8c/) when it made most sense to hold them and when they lost a lot.",

        "content": "Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) is deploying Atomic Canyon’s artificial intelligence-powered solutions for the nuclear energy sector at PG&E’s Diablo Canyon Power Plant, marking the inaugural commercial installation of the first on-site generative AI deployment at a U.S. generating facility.\n\nAtomic Canyon’s Neutron Enterprise generative AI solution, built and running on NVIDIA’s full-stack AI platform, is being deployed at Diablo Canyon for document search and retrieval processes. PG&E also says the AI technology will deliver cost savings and improved operational efficiency.\n\nFederal and state regulations require utilities that operate nuclear power plants to manage “billions of pages” of technical documentation, PG&E said, which are spread across multiple systems. Power plant personnel must spend both time and resources to retrieve this essential data – something PG&E argues the AI will help avoid. Neutron Enterprise is meant to integrate with Diablo Canyon’s systems, using the latest optical character recognition (OCR), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and AI-powered search technology meant to cut search times from hours to seconds.\n\n“As the first nuclear power plant to implement Neutron Enterprise using the NVIDIA platform, we’re proud to lead the way in bringing cutting-edge innovation to our operations,” said Maureen Zawalick, vice president of business and technical services at Diablo Canyon Power Plant. “Atomic Canyon’s AI solutions will enable faster data retrieval, boosting collaboration and ensuring continued safe, but more efficient operations. Accessing critical information in seconds will let us focus on what truly matters—delivering reliable clean energy safely and affordably.”\n\nThe Neutron Enterprise solution is powered by Atomic Canyon’s FERMI family of AI models, developed in collaboration with the Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory and specifically designed for the nuclear energy sector.\n\nAs California’s only remaining nuclear power plant, Diablo Canyon provides nearly 9% of the state’s electricity and generates 17% of its zero-carbon energy. The California Energy Commission estimates that power demand across the state will rise roughly 43% in the next 15 years, which PG&E argues will make Diablo Canyon a more critical clean energy asset.\n\nRead more: \n\n[https://www.power-eng.com/nuclear/pge-to-deploy-nuclear-specific-ai-at-diablo-canyon-plant/](https://www.power-eng.com/nuclear/pge-to-deploy-nuclear-specific-ai-at-diablo-canyon-plant/)\n\n",

        "content": "There may be literally only one stock that has not been swept up by AI hysteria, despite pivoting their business model to adapt to the prospect of generative AI - NICE Ltd.\n\nNICE Ltd., headquartered in Ra'anana, Israel, provides advanced cloud-based software for customer experience (CX) and financial crime prevention. NICE specializes in AI-driven platforms like CXone, which supports customer engagement through AI-based customer routing, automated interactions, and real-time analytics. Their Enlighten AI suite enhances contact center operations by helping agents offer more responsive, personalized service. They also offer solutions for digital evidence management and fraud detection, serving sectors like public safety, law enforcement, and financial compliance.\n\nNICE has been quietly rising ahead of their **earnings call tomorrow**, currently trading around $200. However, it is still WELL off of their high of $250. Their stock price the last several months has seen a sharp decline due to their longtime CEO, Barak Eilam, announcing his departure that will take place at the end of 2024. NICE, in my opinion, has taken an unfair beating for this news. Their replacement, Scott Russell, is an interesting hire due to his experience in the APAC market at a company the size of SAP and his international experience.\n\nNICE has not penetrated the European and APAC market well at all, and this could be an incredible opportunity to grow revenue in those markets with his appointment. They are already well entrenched in some of the largest F500 companies in the Americas. It's about time they start looking abroad.\n\nTo speak on the tech itself, and whether or not generative AI will work in this industry, that itself represents an interesting scenario for NICE. In my opinion, whether or not AI works, NICE is positioned well. Their last earnings call, analysts asked Barak specifically about whether or not their generative AI systems are being used by their customers. He mentioned their proprietary \"co-pilot\", internally-faced AI used by customer service agents is being heavily utilized, and bookings is up 100% YOY for the technology, but that there is definitely still some hesitancy to roll out a generative AI customer service platform to the end consumer. This is fine, in my opinion, because if conceptually it doesn't work, NICE's technology is needed, and will serve the market as it has for years. If generative AI is the solution this industry will need, then they are even better positioned for that against the market with their technology. \n\nSome of the risks that I've heard. One is valid the other isn't. It is an Israeli based company, so there are going to be risks endemic there that are inevitable, which is valid.\n\nI also hear about how large companies like Microsoft and Amazon will enter this market and take away market share. This is really unlikely. Microsoft, for example, tried to do a CRM tool and it is truly dogshit and has close to zero market share. And CX software requires much more domain expertise than doing a CRM tool, which they failed spectacularly at. \n\nI'll spare you the valuation work but...Anyway, stock is fairly priced close to $300, and is currently trading at $200. I got in at $165 earlier this year, but this is still a great opportunity.\n\n\n\n",

        "content": "Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett recently ended a six-year streak of stock buybacks for the company. While the company regularly participates in stock buybacks, it did not do so during the third quarter, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings.\n\nDespite having over $325 billion in cash reserves, Buffett opted not to use that cash to buy back shares, suggesting that he believes the stock is too expensive.\n\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's a limited time opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share before closing date.\n\nThe global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market.\n\nBuffett's approach to stock buybacks is straightforward: he only buys back shares when he considers them a \"bargain.\" According to Berkshire Hathaway's regulatory filings, he looks for a stock price below the company's intrinsic value – a conservative measure considering the long-term worth of Berkshire's assets. Analysts believe the absence of buybacks sends a clear message to the market: Berkshire's stock is overvalued at its current price.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's Class A shares are trading around 1.6 times their book value, representing the company's assets once debts are subtracted. In the past, Berkshire has avoided buybacks when the stock traded above 1.2 times its book value, but that guideline was dropped in 2018.\n\n\nTrending: Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever.\n\nBuffett's conservative investment philosophy remains firm even with a more flexible policy. Robert Korajczyk, a finance professor at Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, explained to CNN, \"He's been very clear that they would never buy back shares if they thought that the firm was overvalued.\"\n\nIn addition to ending its buyback streak, Berkshire increased its already significant cash holdings by selling stocks in the third quarter. Some analysts took this as a cautionary move due to concerns about the current market environment.\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nNYU Stern School of Business professor Aswath Damodaran told CNN that Buffett's decision to hold cash suggests Berkshire is taking a conservative stance, likely due to high stock prices. \"It's a signal that they feel cautious about where the market is,\" Damodaran said. \"They've become cautious because they think the market is richly priced.\"\n\n\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-breaks-6-streak-155338238.html",

In fact, the fund has a 30% short position against it directly, which for an ETF is absolutely bonkers. Now I am not bullish on most of Cathies wild claims, however facts are facts. The call options are not pricing in the potentially huge move this ETF can make.\n\nI don't want this post to get political, I started a discussion on this topic a few days ago and it got banned by mods (my bad for that, wasn't intentional). Yet government funding whether right or wrong can help specific sectors and companies. I truthfully believe that this government (Love or hate them) is going to pump cure related companies.\n\nI don't want to go into too much detail as I wish to stay fully within WSB rules, yet every single person of power including trump, mush, vance and JFK Junior has preached they want the American healthcare to focus on Cure based research.\n\nYou can watch the Joe Rogan with Vance here > [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRyyTAs1XY8&t=500s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRyyTAs1XY8&t=500s)\n\nARKG is absolutely full of said names, and whether the elections are right or wrong (This is not an election post nor political) it's extremely likely that substantial sums of money flows to these names.\n\nYet that's just the starter, when names like NTLA, BEAM etc ran up post covid in 2021 they were nothing more than cash burning Biotechs with fancy titles and ridiculously ambitious goals. To cure diseases at their route cause and potentially cure an array of heredity diseases at birth.\n\nToday we are starting to witness these wild claims become a reality, as most have failed a few winners in the Space have survived, such as CRSP with FDA approval in the USA, UK and Europe for its Sickle Cell disease cure. NTLA is not far away from potentially have a cure worth $20bn whilst its enterprise value sits at a mere $600.\n\nSkip to the 7th Minute where this is discussed In detail: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdctk4YMCfE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdctk4YMCfE)\n\nThen you have names like RXRX which already have a cult following and a pipeline in Oncology worth potentially 10x the Current value of the company. Backed by NVDA and with the largest super computer in the biotech industry worldwide, the CEO even has 90% of his net worth inside the company.\n\nI have gone over all the holdings and checked the financial situation of each company, how much cash runway they have etc and so forth. When I take that into account, along with the rate cuts, the fact that most of the weighted names have huge potential and pipelines, large piles of cash and catalysts pending, this feels like a great arbitrage play.\n\nBiotech has done a whole lot of nothing in 5 years, ever since the first rate hike, even though AI continues to show signs of benefiting the industry. Cathie Wood has become one of the most hated and mocked fund managers of our time. Almost every name has a medium to high short float and the sector isn’t being priced as though a big move is coming, yet the individual holdings do.\n\nBelow are just a few of the big catalysts being released into year end:\n\n1. NTLA ATTR huge data update \n2. BEAM 101 data at ASH \n3. CRSP CTX-112 CAR-T data \n4. NTLA 2002 Phase 2 Data \n5. BEAM 201 Data at ASH \n6. BEAM NHP ESCAPE Data at ASH \n7. SANA Data Update \n\nThe big one is this Saturday with NTLA, if the data is good it will likely push the whole sector into a bullish uptrend, as that cure alone is worth more than almost the entire sector.\n\nIf you don't understand Genomics take some time over the next few days and this weekend to grasp just how much value creation is at stake here. This is the kind of thing we dreamed about 20 Years ago, and it's finally starting to take place.\n\nEverybody is betting against this whole sector turning into a Zero, just as many names begin to not only fulfil their ideas but actually turn a revenue, and significant revenues at that.\n\nSo I'm long Jan calls and just looking what further dated options to pick up.\n\nThese are the top 10 weighted names In the ETF TWST, CRSP, RXRX, ADPT, CDNA, TEM, VCYT, IONS, NTLA, BEAM Incase you want to look them up individually.\n\nSee you in 4-6 weeks with another Banger or a loser haha.",

But I have to trade it in for a Macbook because I’m going to travel and work more remote. \n\nA bit of backstory what I do with this Mac:\nI’m a videographer/editor and use my Mac mainly for editing in Premiere Pro and After Effects. I work with big projects including multiple (10-15) camera’s (Sony, RED, etc.). I edit with 8K footage and a lot of effects. I also do some effects and rotoscoping in After Effects. Beside that no heavy 3D modeling or something like that. \n\nWhat to compare?\n\nMac Studio M1 Ultra (€4599):\n32-core Neural Engine\n48-core GPU\n20-core CPU\n64GB RAM\n1TB SSD\n\nvs\n\nMacbook Pro M4 Max - 14 inch (€3799):\n16-core Neural Engine\n32-core GPU\n14-core CPU\n36GB RAM\n1TB SSD\n\nvs\n\nMacbook Pro M4 Max - 16 inch (€4899):\n16-core Neural Engine\n40-core GPU\n16-core CPU\n64GB\n1TB SSD\n\n—\n\nI’m curious what y’all think about this. I have a feeling I’m losing quite a lot of power comparing the Ultra vs Max chips (less cores). Also doubting what is more important (GPU, CPU, RAM, Neural Engine)?\n\nThanks in advance",

Get it serviced! It was a breeze to use the Apple Support app and start a text conversation. Apple agent was incredibly friendly and helpful, not only offering someone to come pick up the monitor, but also explaining a bit of the technical reasons (fault adhesive) behind the issue and ensuring the replacement part was available for the service center.\n\nI ended up taking the monitor in to a shop rather than having them pick it up, and 24 hours later, the monitor was ready to be picked up. No cost, all under the limited warranty (even though I also have AppleCare+).\n\n It was a breeze, and the difference it makes is MASSIVE. I hope someone see this and finally takes the plunge to fixing their device rather than putting up with something that is “not that big of a deal”. You won’t regret it, and Apple’s support is truly top notch. ",

What was 108k of rklb positions in June now is worth 1.2 million. \n\nCurrent positions and dates purchased.\n1/17/25 5.5c on 6/7/24 \n\n1/16/26 10c on 3/1/24\n\n12/18/26 10c on 8/21/24\n\n22k shares being accumulated since 2022 averaged at $6\n\nA bit of history. Thanks to you absolute degenerate morons I got into options during Covid, like a lot of you. Lost a bunch of money buying weekly spy puts with that one super degen guy, forget his handle. Posted a novel here on shorting spy. \n\nAnyway, through losing a lot of money and occasionally making money I got a good idea of how it works and in 2022 I got a brilliant idea, use the same yolo tactics but on a company I actually understand in a segment I understand(it’s not brilliant, it’s common sense) As a space nerd I thought all of the options were complete trash(rip Astra) until Rocket Lab started acquiring satellite component companies and saw what they were going for. A space company that will make money through vertical integration with big DoD options opening in the near future. Started buying shares then, and then buying leaps when they were down into the 4’s knowing a lot of potential catalyst were on the horizon in 23 and 24. It’s worked! The options in the photo were rolled over from previous positions(except for the 5.5 call, fucking insanity) and some earlier calls I hit on(in previous post) were sold and bought shares with it. \n\nThank you degens, now I gotta figure out wtf to do with this",

        "content": "Hi Redditor,   \nI am 37 years old, with 500k in my 401k. right now it is allocated as folllow IBIT 150k, VOO 300K, and QQQ 50k. It is a traditional IRA on Robinhood. I have basic understanding of investing and i have been doing it for 15 years. I have always invested in VOO mainly, but last year i bought some IBIT and QQQ. I am not looking to retire soon, and i have bought couple propreties for 400k that i rent out at a low ROI of 4% - I consider these safe investement, that's why i am open to take higher risk in stock market. I know i shoudnt time the market, but my gut feeling is telling me a correction/crash is coming soon based on what i have been reading and seeing. Is there a stock market crash proof bond with low return that i can purchase ? can you suggest what new allocation should look like ? I am leaning to replace 50k of QQQ with Bond.   \nThank you.  ",
