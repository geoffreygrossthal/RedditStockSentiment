        "content": "Alphabet-owned Waymo is removing the waitlist for its self-driving service in Los Angeles, marking its largest expansion yet.\n\nStarting Tuesday, anyone in LA will be able to use the Waymo One app to hail a self-driving robotaxi throughout nearly 80 square miles of Los Angeles County, the company said. That includes the 300,000 Angelenos who have been on Waymo’s waitlist.\n\nWith more than 3.8 million people, LA marks the third and largest city where the company’s robotaxi service is now fully available. It follows San Francisco, where Waymo One opened citywide in June. The company opened the service in Phoenix in 2020.\n\n“Now is an exciting time to welcome everyone in Los Angeles along for the ride,” Tekedra Mawakana, co-CEO of Waymo, said in a news release Tuesday. “Our service has matured quickly and our riders are embracing the many benefits of fully autonomous driving. We’re so grateful to all of our first riders in LA, and we can’t wait to serve more riders soon.”\n\nThe company has been rapidly expanding its operations over the last year thanks to additional funding.\n\nWaymo closed a $5.6 billion funding round in October to expand its robotaxi service across the U.S. The autonomous vehicle venture is owned by Google parent Alphabet, which led the series C investment in Waymo, alongside earlier backers including Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity, Perry Creek, Silver Lake, Tiger Global and T. Rowe Price.\n\nThe robotaxi company now sees more than 150,000 paid rides per week across its three markets via the Waymo One app, the company said Tuesday. That’s up from 100,000 in August.\n\nWaymo in September announced that it partnered with Uber to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in 2025. The next-generation robotaxi from Waymo is a Geely Zeekr that’s equipped with custom sensors and an AI “driver.” Waymo also recently agreed to a multiyear strategic partnership with Hyundai that will add the South Korean automaker’s Ioniq 5 electric vehicle to its robotaxi fleet.\n\nThe Waymo One service has been embraced by some women who have safety concerns about riding with unknown human drivers. It has also been used by parents to send their teens to school.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/12/waymo-opens-robotaxi-service-to-anyone-in-los-angeles.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/12/waymo-opens-robotaxi-service-to-anyone-in-los-angeles.html)",

        "content": "Netflix’s cheaper, ad-supported tier has reached 70 million global monthly active users two years after it was launched.\n\nThe company said Tuesday that more than 50% of its new sign-ups are for ad-supported plans in countries that offer the option. Netflix said it continues “to see positive momentum and growth across all areas of the business,” adding it has seen “steady progress across all countries’ member bases.”\n\nNetflix launched the option in November 2022 as one of its responses to a slowdown in subscriber growth.\n\nRecently, subscriber growth hasn’t been an issue. Last month Netflix reported it added 5.1 million subscribers during the third quarter, beating Wall Street estimates. In total, Netflix counts 282.7 million memberships across all of its pricing tiers.\n\nBeginning next year, Netflix said it will no longer update investors on its subscriber numbers as it shifts focus toward revenue and other financial metrics as performance indicators.\n\nWhen Netflix launched its ad platform two years ago, the company said Nielsen would rate its content.\n\nNetflix in May announced it would air two National Football League games on Christmas Day this year as part of a three-year deal. On Tuesday it said it sold out of its ad inventory for the two live games.\n\nNetflix also said it’s brought on FanDuel and Verizon as advertisers for the games. FanDuel will become the exclusive pregame sportsbook betting partner, Netflix said, and will have a sponsored in-show feature.\n\nMedia companies have been focusing on ad-supported strategies for their streaming options that woo customers with cheaper plans and also offer advertising revenue that can help move the streaming businesses toward profitability. While the ad market has been slow for traditional TV, it has grown for streaming and digital businesses.\n\nNetflix offered its last update on its ad-supported tier in May, when it said it reached 40 million global monthly active users, nearly doubling the figure it had shared in January. That announcement came during Upfronts, when media companies make their pitches to advertisers.\n\nNetflix also announced in May it would launch its own advertising platform, ending a partnership with Microsoft for that technology. It’s rolled out the platform in Canada and plans to launch it in the U.S. by the end of the second quarter next year. It plans to set the platform live everywhere by the end of 2025.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/12/netflix-ad-supported-tier-70-million-monthly-users.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/12/netflix-ad-supported-tier-70-million-monthly-users.html)",

        "content": "**1.0 Introduction**\n\neBay was originally called “AuctionWeb” when it launched in 1995. Its founder, Pierre Omidyar, created it as part of his website to experiment with online auctions. He listed his broken laser pointer for sale and sold it for **$14.83**. When he asked if the buyer understood the laser pointer was broken, the buyer responded that he was a collector and was still interested.\n\nIn 1997 the name was changed to eBay, and the rest is history.\n\nThe most expensive item ever sold on eBay is the **Gigayacht**, a 405-foot luxury yacht designed by Frank Mulder. It was purchased for **$168 million** by the Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich.\n\nThe auctions for a lunch with Warren Buffett also took place on eBay, with the 2022 auction being won by a bid of $19 million.\n\n\n\n**2.0 Competition**\n\neBay has been primarily known as the auction go-to-place, as well as the place to go for 2nd hand items. Although there is an overlap with its competitors, there is no doubt that it dominates the 2nd hand market, especially for trading cards and collectibles and it can be labeled as the market leader in Recommerce and auctions.\n\nIts competition comes in different forms:\n\n* **Amazon & Walmart Marketplace** \\- Global eCommerce platforms focused on new products sold by businesses and third-party sellers.\n* **Facebook Marketplace & Craigslist** \\- Local Recommerce platforms enabling individuals to buy/sell used items within their communities.\n* **Etsy** \\- Global eCommerce with a focus on handmade and unique products, though it includes some Recommerce elements for vintage goods.\n\neBay supports eCommerce, but that is a more crowded market, where Amazon is king.\n\n  \n**3.0 Its business model**\n\neBay’s revenue comes in many forms:\n\n* Final value fees\n* Listing fees\n* Feature fees\n* Store subscription fees\n* Sale of advertisements\n* Revenue sharing arrangements\n* Shipping fees, etc.\n\nUltimately, they can be grouped into 2 buckets: Transaction revenue (\\~85%) and advertising (\\~15%).\n\n\n\n**3.1 The key metrics that do not add up**\n\nIn companies of this kind, two important metrics are:\n\n* The **Gross Merchandise Value**, also known as “GMV”, represents the value of all products sold through the website.\n* The **take-rate** represents their share of the GMV.\n\nLet’s have a look at both of them.\n\nThe GMV increased from $73b in 2019 (prior to the pandemic) to $87b during the pandemic and is not back to $74b. However, if you follow their take-rate, it went up from 9% to 14% between 2019 and LTM. But this is slightly misleading. eBay changed the definition of their \"take-rate\" in 2022.\n\nIt used to be calculated as **net transaction revenue** divided by **GMV** and it changed to **net revenue** divided by **GMV**.\n\nSo, I opted for an alternative take-rate, which is definitely not a generally accepted definition. That is: **operating profit** divided by GMV. The outcome is the % of the GMV that is kept by eBay after covering all the operating expenses. There, the increase is minimal, and this adjusted take rate fluctuates around 3%.\n\n\n\n**4.0 Historical Financial Performance**\n\nAlthough its revenue is flat (\\~$10 billion), eBay is a cash-generating machine, bringing **\\~$2 billion** in free cash flow per year *(\\~1.4 billion if SBC is subtracted)*. \n\nBehind the scenes, there’s something else worth noting. Not only has the revenue not been growing, but the composition has changed.\n\n\n\n|Revenue by geography (in $m)|2021|LTM|Change (in %)|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|U.S.|$5.048|$5.185|3%|\n|U.K.|$1.913|$1.588|\\-17%|\n|China|$856|$1.124|31%|\n|Germany|$1.249|$967|\\-23%|\n|Rest of the world|$1.354|$1.402|4%|\n|Total|$10.420|$10.266|\\-1%|\n\nUK and Germany are contributing significantly less, and this decline is being compensated by growth primarily coming from China. Given that China comes with its additional risks (and competition), it can be argued that the revenue today is of lower quality than the revenue back in 2021.\n\nThis could indicate that the penetration rate in the U.S. and Western Europe is at its peak and the average long-term growth that can be expected is around the 3% historical inflation rate.\n\n\n\n**5.0 Capital allocation**\n\nA huge focus of the management has been returning cash to the shareholders.\n\nSince 2019, the company returned almost $28 billion ($25b via buybacks and $3b via dividends). A lot of this came from the company’s free cash flow, but part of it came from divestitures:\n\n* Sold 80% of eBay Korea to eMart.\n* Reduced ownership in Aurelia (the privatized Adevinta entity).\n\n  \nThis led to a reduction of the number of shares outstanding by 40%. This is also a very impressive number if it is presented in isolation. However, half of the repurchases were done in 2020 and 2021, when the share price was quite elevated. In hindsight, that might not have been the best decision.\n\nOne notable long-term investment of theirs is Adyen, where they own 404k shares due to the warrants based on processing volume criteria. Given Adyen’s share price, these are worth around half a billion dollars.\n\n  \n**6.0 Valuation**\n\nThis is the time to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.\n\nThe key question to answer is - **Given what is known today, how much is the company worth?**\n\nBased on everything mentioned above, my best estimate for revenue growth is in line with inflation, as this is a mature market with a high penetration rate in the developed countries.\n\nSimilarly, I do not see any levers that the company can pull to significantly increase its profitability. For that reason, I keep its operating margin at 21%.\n\nBased on my assumptions, the fair value of the company is $20.7b (**$43/share**), significantly below today’s share price of $62.\n\nHere’s how the valuation (per share) changes if you have different assumptions than mine regarding the revenue growth & the operating margin:\n\n\n\n|Revenue / Operating margin|19%|21%|23%|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|0% ($10.3b)|$29|$31|$33|\n|34% ($13.8b)|$40|$43|$47|\n|65% ($17.0b)|$47|$50|$54|\n\n\n\nIf the DCF model is reversed, for eBay to be fairly valued today, it needs to **double in size over the next decade** (average annual revenue growth of 7%) and **increase its operating margin to 23%.** Although this isn’t impossible, there’s no evidence that eBay’s growth will re-accelerate.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this post, feel free to share your thoughts.",

And the U.S. is about to push through massive tax cuts and regulatory reform. The rocket has already made it to moon, now we're just refueling for Mars\n\nSo what's the play going forward? Well over the past week the one thing that will likely benefit most from deregulation has been almost flat. Natural gas. \n\nIn the U.S., gas is cheap. Dirt cheap. It's basically a waste product from oil production at this point and we just burn the stuff at the wellhead because there's not enough pipeline capacity to get it to the customers.\n\nDomestically, we are going to need a ton of energy for everything from data centers to manufacturing and there are no sources that can be brought on as fast as natural gas. So why haven't we expanded our pipeline capacity already? Simple, regulation has made the prospect of pipeline expansion unrealistic. But that's going to change. Unlocking oil and gas is expected to be a day 1 Executive Order. \n\nInternationally, the picture is looking even brighter. Turns out we're the only ones with dirt cheap natural gas. The rest of the world pays 10x or more what we do for natural gas. And now the U.S. wants to dominate energy exports. We are about to see LNG exports become a cornerstone of American trade policy. \n\nPosition- $LNG 3/21/25C, $ET 6/20/25C\n\nTldr: LNG and Pipelines 🚀 🚀 🚀 on day 1 Executive Orders\n\nThis is not financial advice. I'm just a fellow moron with a few news subscriptions and too much time on my hands. Do your own due diligence. \n",

But Rack/ Data Center Tech Design and Architecture, there will BE ZERO INCENTIVE FOR CUSTOMERS TO GO TO COMPETITORS WHEN RACK ARCHITECTURE THAT FITS BLACKWELL GPU's with ZERO ISSUE, IS COMPLETELY OUT IN THE OPEN: READ SUMMARY( this is why AMD and INTEL are having such a hard time competing and frankly anybody else, unless you're DELL and WORKING with Jensen... But Dell doesn't make chips, so their good bros and compliment each other very well in many ways, STILL NVDA HAS IT'S OWN DATA CENTER RACK TECHNOLOGY THAT IS NOT DELL'S AND IT IS NOW OPEN SOURCE- FROM COOLING TO ETHERNET AND SCALING DATA TECHNOLOGY... GIVING THEM A MASSIVCE ADVANTAGE.. vs those that want to take away their Data Center Service / Business :\n\nThis OCP summit with this open sourcing debut specifically for Blackwell tech was as of last month, Oct 17th.\n\n( Jensen is busy busy busy )  \n\"At this year’s OCP Global Summit, NVIDIA will be sharing key portions of the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system’s electro-mechanical design with the OCP community — including the rack architecture, compute and switch tray mechanicals, liquid-cooling and thermal environment specifications, and NVIDIA NVLink™ cable cartridge volumetrics—to support higher compute density and networking bandwidth.\"  \n..\"said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “By advancing open standards, we’re helping organizations worldwide take advantage of the full potential of accelerated computing and create the AI factories of the future.”\n\n[https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-contributes-blackwell-platform-design-to-open-hardware-ecosystem-accelerating-ai-infrastructure-innovation](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-contributes-blackwell-platform-design-to-open-hardware-ecosystem-accelerating-ai-infrastructure-innovation)\n\nEverybody KNOWS there is a plateau. A plateau and lower business revenues based on estimates that TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT INFERENCE IS LESS DEMANDING THAN TRAINING. THAT BEING SAID, MARKET IS NO LONGER LOOKING FOR INSANE NUCLEAR GROWTH. BUT STEADY HEALTHY GROWTH. THAT\\*\\* WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER.\n\nCrazy AI nuclear growth, is not what the market is expecting. Market is expecting a healthy stable growth, now that we are near equilibrium with AI and chips, ( this is obviously not true, but it's the arguments bears try to hang on. They think Amazon will overtake a 30 year CUDA industry software environment the entire world/industry has created THEIR ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE, BOTH SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE AROUND). Go look up CUDA. It's older than many traders here. There is no world, or dimension, in the slightest, where a newcomer, or an online retailer, will wrap up 30yrs in a qtr or two. Or three, or four... NVDA continues to climb on growth, steady healthy growth, not insane nuclear growth. THAT WILL PROPEL THIS STOCK HIGHER. It has no where else to go. Ive's and Wedbush, are ENTIRELY correct.\n\nDan Ives and Josh Brown Discuss NVDA  \n[https://youtu.be/u-95RKiEl5o?si=8Cpbr3LFWE9WsVju](https://youtu.be/u-95RKiEl5o?si=8Cpbr3LFWE9WsVju)\n\nI'm not your mom.

        "content": "Monolithic Power Systems (MPWR) – These guys aren’t some rando chip stock. They’ve been around since ‘97, pumping out high-performance power tech across cloud, telecom, cars, industrial gear, and gadgets. They’re out of Kirkland, WA, and have secured a spot as a serious player in the semiconductor game.\n\n**Stock Moves** 💸\n\nSo MPWR’s been on a wild ride lately, down to $638.26 as of Nov. 12, tanking 13.98% after hitting $689 intraday. We saw a low of $610. But the analysts? They’re **not sweating it**.\n\n**Analyst Degen Ratings** 🚀💰\n\nEven with the recent dips, the big brains on Wall Street still say “buy.” Check out these price targets:\n\n* **Truist Financial** – William Stein said **BUY** on Oct. 31 and juiced his target to $994 from $918.\n* **Stifel Nicolaus** – On Oct. 9, Stifel kept the “BUY” train rolling with a target hike to $1,100.\n* **TD Cowen** – Matt Ramsay (Diamond Hands) dropped a **BUY** on Oct. 31 with a $975 target.\n* **Rosenblatt** – Back on Oct. 29, they called **BUY** with a $880 target.\n* **Needham & Co.** – On Nov. 11, Quinn Bolton didn’t flinch. Still **BUY** at $950.\n\nThe **average target** sits around **$942.40**, so we’re looking at a potential upside of about **23%** if the suits are right. That’s a **Strong Buy Consensus** across the board. 🤑\n\n**Latest Drama** 📉💥\n\nMPWR got slapped with a 15% drop on Nov. 11 after some rumors claimed they might lose Nvidia’s business. But MPWR’s management said “Fake News” – no issues with Nvidia, and the analysts were quick to back ‘em up. Just noise, or time to load the dip?\n\n**TL;DR** 🦍💎🙌\n\nMPWR’s a big fish in the semiconductor pond with killer positioning in high-growth sectors. Analysts are still diamond-handing it, so if you’re looking for a semi play with strong fundamentals, this could be it. Get ready for a rocket or a rollercoaster.\n\n  \nPositions Posted Below: \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/r81bpq3rhi0e1.png?width=1926&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc30c9a813b39fc2e84e047ef16b819cdc38a2e1\n\n",

Still got my M1 Pro 16 inch, hadn't had to use any of the campus' computers so far. Matlab, Fusion360, Arduino, all work great natively. I've got Parallels 20 too for stuff that hasn't been ported, programs like SolidWorks run great and there's even a mod to get realview graphics to work. There may be a point in time where I have to get Ansys to work, that's where there might be some problems. \n\nMany people said you shouldn't have an Apple Silicon Mac as your main computer for many engineering courses. Haven't really had the \"pain\" people have talked about using a Mac for such a course. Would like to know other's experiences with engineering software on a Mac!",

Currently, MSTR is approximately 70th and therefore likely to be added.\n\nDec 10th - MSFT shareholder vote on Bitcoin: Microsoft will hold a shareholder vote to decide on whether to add an allocation of Bitcoin to their balance sheet.

If many options are near or in-the-money, market makers may need to buy large quantities of MSTR stock to hedge their positions.

Increased regulatory clarity may have a positive impact on Bitcoin's price.\n\nJan 29th - January Fed meeting: A possible interest rate cut could have positive impact on MSTR/Bitcoin's price.\n\nFeb 9th - MSTR Q4 / 10K earnings: Might offer insights into MSTR's Bitcoin purchases, holdings and strategy, potentially influencing MSTR’s stock price. FASB accounting could have a positive impact on earnings, although this is more likely to be implemented for Q1 2025 earnings.\n\nFeb 11th - MSCI quarterly review: A snapshot is taken to determine changes to company allocations in the index. A significant increase in MSTR's market cap could result in a higher weighting within the index. To reflect this change, more MSTR shares will need to be purchased by MSCI to rebalance.\n\nMar 3rd - MSCI quarterly rebalance: The index is rebalanced by this date.\n\nApr 30th - Russell index ranking day: A snapshot is taken to determine changes to company allocations in the index.

To reflect this change, more MSTR shares will need to be purchased by the Russell index to rebalance.\n\nMay 5th - MSTR World: A 4-day event for MicroStrategy that may include Bitcoin related announcements which could have a positive impact on MSTR and Bitcoin price.\n\nMay 6th - MSTR Q1 earnings (FASB accounting): Implementation of FASB accounting rules will change how MSTR's Bitcoin holdings are reported, potentially releasing a net income gain of over $10 billion. Negative Earnings Per Share (EPS) over several previous quarters could be eradicated, qualifying MSTR for inclusion in the S&P 500. Investors may look to front-run S&P 500 inclusion, if they have not already done so.\n\nMay 13th - MSCI quarterly review: A snapshot is taken to determine changes to company allocations in the index.

Currently have around 900k SGD in liquid investments and planning to retire with 1.1\\~1.2M SGD at 35. At this amount, I can retire comfortably with 4% SWR. If I wanna travel 3\\~4 times a year and enjoy life more I need 5\\~6% SWR.\n\nAfter SPY ran up to 600 yesterday, I bought some 5%\\~35%(570-390) XSP 403dte(expire 19 Dec 2025) LEAPS put debit spread at $16(2.66% of underlying) to protect against my SPY shares proportionally.\n\nThen I used 60% of my account margin to sell 25 120dte ES naked calls at 7200(20% OTM). The collected premiums that amounted to 0.8% of my SPY shares value. I plan to cover my position when it has decayed by 50% and rinse repeat until I get 2.66% of my money back to make my protective puts “free”.\n\nIn the scenario that that SPY continues to go ballistic and runs up 15% again(90dte 6900 ES currently has a 1.6 delta) in the next 3months. My ES naked calls should go up 400%(based on the current 30dte 5% OTM call price) and I will have to roll them at a 3.2% loss. But I will still be up 15% from my share price.\n\nI did some research and SPY has never ever went up 20% in 4 months after hitting ATH or within 3% of ATH in the past 30yrs, so it feels like my naked calls on margin are quite safe. And even if an anomaly happens, I still can close them out on a loss while still making much more from my shares.\n\nI plan to do this on a yearly basis so my maximum downside is 5% anually(unless SPY drops more than 35% in a year) while still enjoying the full run up of SPY on bullish years.\n\nSome math based on past 30yrs of SPY performance.\n\nScenario 1 - If you invested $100 in SPY from 1993 to 2023 without any withdrawal\n\n\\- Without 5% downside cap - $1183\n\n\\- With 5% downside cap + puts are free - $2851\n\n\\- With 5% downside cap + pay 3% annually for puts - $1520\n\nScenario 2 - If you invested $100 in SPY from 1993 to 2023 with 5% annual withdrawal\n\n\\- Without 5% downside cap - $253\n\n\\- With 5% downside cap + puts are free - $612\n\n\\- With 5% downside cap + pay 3% annually for puts - $326\n\nScenario 3 - If you invested $100 in SPY from 2000 to 2009(most bearish stretch of SPY in past 30yrs) without 5% annual withdrawal\n\n\\- Without 5% downside cap - $69\n\n\\- With 5% downside cap - $145\n\n\\- With 5% downside cap + pay 3% annually for puts - $127\n\nScenario 4 - If you invested $100 in SPY from 2000 to 2009(most bearish stretch of SPY in past 30yrs) with 5% annual withdrawal\n\n\\- Without 5% downside cap - $44\n\n\\- With 5% downside cap - $91\n\n\\- With 5% downside cap + pay 3% annually for puts - $80\n\nWhat do you think? Anyone running protective/hedging strategies after the recent bull run? Is there any reason not to run protective puts on your account if you plan on steadily withdrawing it soon?",
