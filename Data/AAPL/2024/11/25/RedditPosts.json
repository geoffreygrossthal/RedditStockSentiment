        "content": "Finally back in the green over all time 😂😭 \n\nMade a bad call back in March holding onto what seemed like a pretty safe call debit spread on SMCI (actually posted about it back then too lmao 😬). Long story short SMCI closed right at the short leg strike point, so whoever was holding onto the 10 contracts I was short on decided not to exercise, leaving me long on 1000 very pricey and very volatile shares of SMCI. Ended up getting margin called that weekend and losing almost 11k when markets opened that Monday 🙃\n\nProceeded to make a series of bad panic option trades on NVDA and Adobe over the following months trying to recoup my losses, dropping me further into the red. Was down about 18k at the beginning of September\n\nFinally had a stroke of luck with a well played call spread on MSI (posted about that too), then rode the election wave up to the green over the past few weeks. Special thanks to RDDT and TSLA 🙏\n\nMoral of the story: still got a month to try and beat SPY gains for the year. Happy Thanksgiving regards",
