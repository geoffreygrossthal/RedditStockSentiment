        "content": "Overview:  \n$HIMS has been delivering impressive financial growth, even as Amazon attempts its way into the healthcare space with its One Medical acquisition. Amazon officially acquired One Medical on February 22, 2023, and in November 2023, it started offering discounted memberships to Amazon Prime customers. Despite Amazon, $HIMS has continued to thrive over the past year, showing resilience in the face of increased competition. The recent price dip presents a buying opportunity for investors.\n\n$HIMS has also raised its full-year 2024 revenue guidance to a range of $1.460 billion to $1.465 billion and its adjusted EBITDA guidance to between $173 million and $178 million.\n\nQuarterly Financial Highlights (YoY for Q3 2024):\n\n* Revenue: $401.56M (+77.13%)\n* Net Income: $75.59M (+1098.92%) ‚Äì HIMS is profitable.\n* Diluted EPS: 0.32 (+900%) ‚Äì Significant earnings growth.\n* Net Profit Margin: 18.82% (+663.47%) ‚Äì Margin improvements show operational efficiency.\n* Operating Income: $22.37M (+361.56%)\n* Net Change in Cash: $36.22M (+588.11%)\n* Over 2 million customers (+44%) with increasing revenue per customer of $67 (+24%)\n\n[$Hims subscriber count increase and revenue increase](https://preview.redd.it/q4jyciaqf01e1.png?width=1208&format=png&auto=webp&s=a431a83bbdfd6a1db9330f643bbb2fdfb23accf7)\n\nAmazon - Why It Matters for $HIMS:\n\n1. Amazon‚Äôs Reach and Pricing Power: With Amazon now offering discounted One Medical memberships to Prime members, its reach and pricing power could potentially attract customers quickly, posing a challenge to $HIMS‚Äôs growth.\n2. Enhanced Services for Prime Members: Amazon‚Äôs ability to bundle healthcare with Prime adds convenience for its vast user base, appealing to those who value integrated services.\n3. Increased Competition: Amazon‚Äôs formal ‚Äúentry‚Äù into telehealth means $HIMS and similar companies will need to differentiate themselves more strongly to retain market share.\n\nThe Bull Case for $HIMS Despite Amazon:\n\n* Strong Financial Growth: $HIMS has shown impressive year-over-year growth in both revenue and profitability, with a loyal customer base and solid fundamentals.\n* Niche Focus: HIMS focuses on personal health and wellness, including hair loss and sexual health treatments‚Äîareas that aren't the primary focus of One Medical. This specialization could help $HIMS create a loyal customer segment.\n* Early Mover Advantage: HIMS has a longer-standing presence in digital health and a well-established platform, giving it an edge in areas Amazon may not emphasize.\n* Privacy and Discretion: Many customers prefer a separate, private platform for personal wellness products. HIMS offers a level of discretion Amazon can‚Äôt match, which could be important for products like ED treatments. Also, Amazon‚Äôs ad-driven model might make some users uncomfortable if sensitive purchases are targeted by advertisers.\n\nRisks:\n\n* Amazon‚Äôs Potential to Undercut Prices: Amazon‚Äôs pricing power and ability to offer discounts through Prime could put pressure on $HIMS to stay competitive on price.\n* Brand Loyalty Shift: Amazon‚Äôs backing of One Medical and integration with Prime could entice some of $HIMS's customers to switch, especially those already invested in the Amazon ecosystem.\n\nTL;DR:  \n$HIMS is on a strong growth path, with impressive financials and a niche focus in the wellness and telehealth market. Amazon's acquisition of One Medical over a year ago and recent push into the space does increase competition, but $HIMS has proven resilient over the past year against Amazon and continues to improve its metrics. With a clear strategy and focus on privacy and niche offerings, $HIMS may have the staying power to thrive alongside Amazon's ‚Äúrelease‚Äù into the space. The recent price drop could be an opportunity to buy.\n\nPositions:\n\n1500 shares & 10 calls @$20 1/16/26\n\nThis is my first DD, plz be gentle with this regard",

There‚Äôs probably a subreddit with 20,000 members floating around.\n\n-Licensing reams of data to LLM/AI companies.

They are very cognizant of dilution. \n\n-Probably the best place online for brands to connect with customers and to also gauges brand temperature. Very authentic human interactions and discussions due to the huge amount of users and the downvoting system which gets rid of bot replies and pushes good content to the top. \n\n-Massive moat / barrier to entry. How can it be replicated? Would be extremely difficult and costly.\n\n-Can really start to get a piece of the global advertising pie if they can fix their search function.\n\nCons\n-Google can stop promoting Reddit in search results, which would limit user growth.\n\n-Users that come in from Google aren‚Äôt logged in, thus generate less revenue from ads.\n\n-Once they capture the low hanging fruit from running relevant ads, what is the growth strategy that gets them to a much higher valuation ($100 billion+)?\n",

        "score": 0,
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1gs0l03/amazon_accelerates_q3_growth_with_aws_and_holiday/",
        "content": "# Summary\n\n* **Buy Recommendation:** Amazon's strong growth, AWS dominance, and robust holiday outlook make it attractive.\n* **AWS Key Driver:** AWS contributes 60% of Amazon‚Äôs Q3 2024 operating income, insulating it from e-commerce volatility.\n* **Profit Impact:** AWS‚Äôs high margins boost Amazon‚Äôs overall profitability and market value.\n* **Earnings Beat:** Q3 exceeded Wall Street estimates, boosting investor confidence.\n* Retail Growth: North American and international eCommerce sales rose, improving margins and profitability.\n* **Q4 Outlook:** The holiday season and AWS are expected to drive strong revenue growth.\n* Inflation Benefit: Falling inflation boosts consumer spending power, aiding Amazon‚Äôs revenue.\n* **Long-Term Expansion:** AWS, Prime, and global reach position Amazon for sustained growth.\n\n# Introduction: Setting the Stage\n\nAmazon‚Äôs growth trajectory is very strong, driven by its diversified business model, innovations, and a focus on long-term growth. The company‚Äôs performance in recent quarters shows its resilience even with challenges. An important factor in all of this is Amazon‚Äôs success in Amazon Web Services (AWS). In Q3 2024, AWS generated $10 billion in operating income, which is 60% of Amazon‚Äôs total operating income. This shows the role that AWS plays in Amazon‚Äôs growth and financial success, strengthening the company‚Äôs valuation and protecting it from the general volatility in e-commerce. AWS‚Äôs high-margin business model has allowed Amazon to expand profit while also maintaining growth, further making the company a dominant player in cloud computing. AWS continues to outperform expectations as Amazon‚Äôs e-commerce is steadily growing. The company‚Äôs outlook remains strong, providing confidence in its growth potential.\n\n**AWS Segment Overview and Profit Growth**\n\nAWS has significantly impacted Amazon‚Äôs growth and valuation by transforming the company‚Äôs business model and driving profitability beyond its core e-commerce operations. As Amazon‚Äôs cloud computing arm, AWS has consistently contributed a major share of Amazon‚Äôs operating income, thanks to its high margins relative to the low-margin retail business. In 2023, AWS generated over $80 billion in revenue, representing about 16%-18% of Amazon's total revenue and underscoring its role as a key financial driver. This reliable revenue stream not only offsets the volatile nature of retail but has also contributed to Amazon‚Äôs robust valuation by positioning it as a dominant player in the rapidly expanding cloud computing market. AWS‚Äôs growth is further supported by strategic partnerships with major clients like T-Mobile, Toyota, and Epic Games, which highlight its adaptability across industries‚Äîfrom enhancing 5G infrastructure and automotive technologies to providing advanced computing for game development. These contracts not only bolster AWS‚Äôs revenue but also reinforce Amazon‚Äôs brand as a tech innovator, driving investor confidence and contributing to Amazon‚Äôs overall market value. AWS has become a major factor in Amazon's financial success, having a huge impact on the company‚Äôs profits. In Q3 2024, for instance, AWS generated $10.4 billion in operating income‚Äîa 50% increase from the previous year. AWS makes up 60% of the company‚Äôs total operating income and has an operating margin of 38%. These statistics show how AWS operates and uses its large scale to keep costs low.¬†\n\n**Q3 Earnings Results and Beating Estimates**\n\nAmazon‚Äôs retail division experienced notable growth in Q3, with North American sales rising 9% year-over-year (YoY) to $95.5 billion and international sales increasing 12% YoY to $35.9 billion, outperforming the previous quarter‚Äôs growth rates of 9% and 7%, respectively. This growth reflects sustained consumer demand, particularly in Prime subscriptions and eCommerce, alongside a steady increase in third-party marketplace sales. In North America, 2023 revenue grew by 7.9% YoY, from $315 billion in 2022 to $340 billion, with operating profit rising 22.2% from $18 billion to $22 billion, driven by enhanced logistics networks, higher cost-efficiency, and high-margin services like Prime. Operating margins in North America improved significantly, reaching 5.9%, showcasing Amazon‚Äôs ability to leverage its infrastructure for increased profitability. Meanwhile, international sales grew more moderately by 5.0% YoY, from $140 billion in 2022 to $147 billion in 2023, as economic conditions and logistics costs across diverse markets tempered growth. While international operating profit rose slightly from $5 billion to $5.2 billion, margins remained constrained by global expansion costs and currency fluctuations, though they turned positive in Q3, reaching 3.6%, up from a negative 0.3% last year. Amazon‚Äôs logistics optimization, such as regional fulfillment centers, has played a key role in reducing shipping costs and enhancing delivery speed, benefiting profitability in both segments. To address slower international profit growth, Amazon may need to focus on automation, cost-effective delivery, and leveraging AWS to strengthen its margins further.\n\n**Forecast for Q4 and Beyond**\n\nAmazon is poised for strong Q4 growth, driven by robust consumer spending and increased holiday season sales. Net sales are expected to grow significantly, with projections ranging from $181.5 billion to $188.5 billion, marking a 7% to 11% increase over the previous year. This reflects the company‚Äôs ability to leverage seasonal demand and capitalize on strategic promotions, including discounts and exclusive deals. Compared to two years ago, when net sales stood at $149.2 billion, this quarter‚Äôs projected performance highlights a substantial growth trajectory, supported by the ongoing expansion of e-commerce and enhanced logistics capabilities. Additionally, operating income is anticipated to rise in tandem with sales, underscoring the profitability of holiday-driven demand. In the last quarter of the 2024 year, Amazon‚Äôs performance, specifically its growth, will likely be due to its top-performing areas, AWS and Amazon Prime. AWS provides large amounts of profit from its cloud computing technology, services that are only expected to improve Amazon‚Äôs standing as many companies are beginning to utilize it as they expand into more modern cloud services. Additionally, Prime‚Äôs investments in more warehouses and improved delivery systems, both contributing to faster product delivery, directly contributes to the projected growth of Amazon as a whole. Adaptations to Prime‚Äôs entertainment and streaming content have begun to be based on regional preferences, increasing subscriptions and therefore company revenue. In the long term, Amazon‚Äôs growth internationally will be a big factor in its overall success. By expanding Prime benefits in regions like Asia, Latin America, and Europe, Amazon is adjusting its services to fit local needs, including faster delivery, special shopping events, and more region-specific streaming content. While there are some challenges, like high delivery costs and currency changes, Amazon‚Äôs focus on building efficient delivery systems and offering local content for Prime members is setting it up to win over more customers globally. These efforts should help Amazon grow steadily and strengthen its presence worldwide in the years to come.\n\n**Impact of Falling Inflation on Amazon**\n\nAs inflation rates continue to fall, Amazon stands to benefit from increased consumer spending power, especially in discretionary categories such as electronics and household goods. Lower inflation means that consumers‚Äô purchasing power is less eroded by price increases, encouraging more frequent and larger purchases. This shift can translate into stronger revenue growth for Amazon, particularly as the holiday season approaches, when spending naturally spikes. The added spending capacity from a lower inflation environment could help Amazon meet or exceed its Q4 projections and reinforce its market position. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) slowed to 3.7% in September 2024, down from 9.1% in 2022, while the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index also eased to 3.5% in August. This has led to increased consumer spending, with personal consumption expenditures growing 3.2% annually in Q2 2024. Retail sales rose 4.4% in August, driven by demand for higher-ticket items. With more disposable income, consumers are likely to spend more on non-essential goods, positioning Amazon to benefit from this shift, particularly as the holiday season approaches.\n\n**Seasonal Boost from Holiday Sales**\n\nAmazon‚Äôs season of growth and income is during late Q4 or the holiday season in lay man‚Äôs terms. In the United States, retail business generally sees an incredible boost, due to the consumerist culture of holiday season in America. Amazon and other stores like Ebay, Best Buy, and more have embraced this by giving out solid deals on common items gifted during the holidays. Electronics, toys, and clothing are the most common discounted items during this season, with that making up the majority of items on sale during this period. American retailers have caught up to this, creating masterful promotions informing consumers about the deals on popular products going on during the holidays. Amazon is one of the leaders in this section, with the festive decor lining the site, to the well-placed advertisements, to even the special packaging. The most important day of this part of Q4, is Black Friday. Black Friday, for those who don‚Äôt know, is a holiday in America which is on the day after Thanksgiving. Black Friday is seen as a holiday at the shops, where numerous stores will bring heavy discounts on a large variety of items. Black Friday is important to consumers, due to its prime location near the beginning on the chaotic run to Christmas and other early winter holidays. Amazon has mostly focused on Cyber Monday, a day on the Monday after thanksgiving week oriented to online shopping, but as the in-store culture of Black Friday goes down Amazon has been promoting Black Friday more heavily. This is a critical time for the Washington State based company as Black Friday only flourishes when the economy is booming, and with many Americans having issues monetarily companies will need to bring out more lucrative offers and advertising to win over customers. Last year, Amazon was able to bring in almost $10 Billion from Black Friday alone, making investors very cheerful during the holiday season. This year, if Amazon is able to recreate it‚Äôs smart advertising based in holiday cheer, solid deals, and build hype, they will easily move past the challenges being faced by American citizens.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\n# Amazon's projected temple of growth and profitability domonstrates that the company is armed with strategies that will enable it come out bigger and better in the end. E-commerce growth strengthened by logistics, together with personalization of shopping, cuts into the consumer's loyalty and market share. It is also noted that Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a profit center all its own due to its very high margins and strong market demands for cloud services.The article continues with the growth of Amazon's ad business, collecting targeted consumer data at low cost, as other income streams eg: Prime subscriptions and services for third-party sellers. All these bring about large amounts of cash and help retain customers. Global expansion to those lesser-explored geographical markets would eventually provide Amazon an opportunity for long-term growth by entering customers neeing U.S. and European saturation. Sustainability initiatives will resonate with the consumers' eco-responsible inclinations, which will help build brand loyalty and reduce costs over time.Not the least of which, innovation is part of the great Amazon EQ; investments made on innovation are always on AI, automation, and some machine learning processes to enable efficiency and open the door for other opportunities while fortifying the competition.\n\n  \n\n\n**TLDR**: Amazon is known for being an outstanding leader in e-commerce, and cloud computing which has been displayed through its recent profit growth and Q3 earnings. With these factors, Amazon is positioned to continue its growth in Q4 as it leverages holiday sales and AWS offerings making it a good buying opportunity.",

Not saying that these are dealbreakers but yeah...\n\nWhat does speak against Intel: org is too messed to get it ever restructured and/or reorg too expensive, running out of money (but gov money), time, building fabs needs years, zero EUV experience, low yields for years\n\nEdit: Intel has a lower market cap than AMD despite AMD just having design in-house, they have more assets in the GPU department but it is insignificant compared to something like Nvidia and if we talk about IGPUs Intel seem to be on par\n\nEdit2: Would at least a new CEO just give us a bump, so we could leave again with some short-term gains?\n\nEdit3: typos\n\nSo, is buying Intel really a risk with its dirt-cheap pricing right now? Is it really \"dirt-cheap\"?",
