Tech research firm Tech Insights had taken apart the product, revealing the TSMC chip and apparent violation of export controls.\n\nHuawei, at the center of the U.S. action, is on a restricted trade list, which requires suppliers to obtain licenses to ship any goods or technology to the company. Any license that could aid Huawei's AI efforts would likely be denied.\n\nTSMC suspended shipments to China-based chip designer Sophgo after its chip matched the one found on the Huawei AI processor, sources told Reuters last month.\n\nReuters could not determine how the chip ended up on Huawei's Ascend 910B, released in 2022, viewed as the most advanced AI chip available from a Chinese company.\n\nThe latest clampdown hits many more companies and will allow the U.S. to assess whether other companies are diverting chips to Huawei for its AI processor.\n\nAs a result of the letter, TSMC notified affected clients that it was suspending shipments of chips starting Monday, the person said.\nThe Commerce Department declined comment.\n\nA spokesperson for TSMC also declined to comment beyond saying it was a \"law-abiding company...committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.\"\n\nThe Commerce Department communication -- known as an \"is informed\" letter -- allows the U.S. to bypass lengthy rule-writing processes to quickly impose new licensing requirements on specific companies.\n\nIjiwei, a Chinese media site covering the semiconductor industry, reported on Friday that TSMC notified Chinese chip design companies it would suspend 7 nanometer or below chips for AI and GPU customers beginning Nov. 11.\n\nThe action comes as both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about the inadequacy of export controls on China and the Commerce Department's enforcement of them.\n\nIn 2022, the Commerce Department sent is-informed letters to Nvidia and AMD restricting their ability to export top AI-related chips to China, and to chip equipment makers like Lam Research, Applied Materials and KLA to restrict tools to make advanced chips to China.\n\nThe restrictions in those letters were later turned into rules that apply to companies beyond them.\n\nThe U.S. has been delayed in updating rules on tech exports to China. As Reuters reported in July, the Biden administration drafted new rules on some foreign exports of chipmaking equipment and planned to add about 120 Chinese companies to the Commerce Department's restricted entity list, including chipmaking factories, toolmakers, and related companies.\n\nBut despite plans for an August release, and later tentative target dates for publication, the rules still have not been issued.",

        "content": "Let’s face it, prior to a month or two ago, it’s been pretty terrible for the Bitcoin mining industry. Across the board it almost all affected companies were down. RIOT in particular. \n\nBut here’s Why I’m Excited About This Stock. Some of which applies to Bitcoin mining in general. \n\n RIOT is on the move. The stock has surged to $12.64 this week with impressive trading volumes.\n\nKey Points:\n\n1. Massive Mining Infrastructure\n\nRIOT operates some of the largest bitcoin mining facilities in the world, including the Corsicana site (with 600MW still under construction) and Rockdale (700MW). While other miners like IREN are planning large-scale sites, RIOT's operations are already up and running, and they’re far ahead in terms of scale.\n\n2. Bitcoin Price Surge\n\nBitcoin is riding high, currently above $80,000 (and some analysts predict it could hit $100,000 by year-end). RIOT holds over 10,000 BTC, which means as bitcoin prices rise, so does RIOT’s asset base.\n\n3. Future Goals\n\nRIOT’s ambition to hit 100 EH/s by 2027 positions them as a leader in mining hash rate, further boosting their long-term potential.\n\n4. AI Potential\n\nWhat excites me even more is CEO Jason Les mentioning that RIOT is open to AI opportunities. With their massive mining facilities in Texas—close to key urban centers like Austin and Dallas, with access to cheap power and low latency—they’re perfectly positioned to pivot into AI workloads if the right deal comes along. The growing demand for GPUs in AI, paired with RIOT’s vast infrastructure, could make them a key player in this space as well. Jason has already mentioned they have received a lot of interest in this direction.\n\n5. Political & Market Factors\n\nWith Trump returning to office, there could be major benefits for U.S.-based miners. Increased support for domestic bitcoin mining and the likelihood of regulatory changes to ease production could propel bitcoin—and in turn, RIOT—to new highs. As bitcoin rises, so does RIOT's profitability.\n\nThe Big Picture:\nI’m not claiming RIOT is the only player to watch, but they’re certainly one of the biggest and in a strong position. With bitcoin price potentially reaching $100,000 in the near future, we could see RIOT’s stock easily hit $20-$25 by the end of the year, and $50+ if the market conditions continue to favor them.",

I’d love to get more feedback of what you like and dislike about the app so I can make it even better.\n\n**What’s next?** Tighter integration with Reminders, cooler macOS UI, more fun features for visionOS. It’s all underway and we have quite a community driving this forward 😀\n\n🌁 **Screenshot**: [https://www.finalist.works/2-1-screenshot/](https://www.finalist.works/2-1-screenshot/)\n\n**📼 Video**: [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/zTcs5a1B59I](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/zTcs5a1B59I)\n\n**📱 App Store**: [https://apps.apple.com/app/id6447014685](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6447014685)\n\n**🖥️ Web**: [https://finalist.works](https://finalist.works/)\n\nThanks for your time and have a great Sunday 🙏\n\nEdit: if the store is asking you to pay for Lifetime something's wrong, don't do it - just DM me instead.\n\nEdit 11:59pm: thanks all for playing, we gave away a LOT of lifetimes 😀",

So instead of being a typical app with sounds like rain, or fire, I thought about fans and their various different kinds and sounds! So this app allows you to place realistic looking and sounding fans around your environment. You can adjust the sound and reverb of each fan. There are 8 different fan types to choose from:\n\n\t•\tBox Fan\n\t•\tStanding Fan\n\t•\tTower Fan\n\t•\tBladeless Fan\n\t•\tAir Conditioner\n\t•\tCeiling Fan\n\t•\tTable Fan\n\t•\tAir Vent\n\nLet the record show, I tried to call this “Only Fans: Ambient Sounds” but Apple (understandably) wasn’t allowing it since it was too close to the OnlyFans trademark, haha. They wouldn’t even allow a simple tagline of “The Only Fans You Need!” I understand and expected this, but hey, it was worth a shot!\n\n-–––––––\n\n2.\tVisionary: Earnings Tracker\n\nLink: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/visionary-earnings-tracker/id6692608433\n\nInspired by other similar earnings apps, I decided to take this motivating concept and flesh it out with some ideas and preferences of my own, and after much deliberation, polished it to release it to the world! This allows you to get a visual of the money you are earning while working. Whether it is for fun, motivation, or to track how much to bill a client, I personally found this concept super motivating! Having something tangible in front of you versus just a number really makes it feel rewarding, in my opinion.\n\nIt currently only supports USD and I am considering adding other currency in the future!\n\n-–––––––\n\nI hope you guys enjoy and these help make your lives a little better!

I apologise for the bug!\n\nHi r/apple,\n\nAbout 4 months ago, I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1ejs8gv/i_spent_2_years_making_yet_another_todo_app_yata/) introducing [Yet Another Todo App (Yata)](https://apps.apple.com/app/yata-yet-another-to-do-app/id1631370175), and the positive reception was extremely motivating. As a result, my goal of making a native app on every Apple platform (well, almost--sorry Apple TV!) has been reached much earlier than I ever anticipated!\n\nTo express my gratitude for this subreddit, the **Lifetime IAP** will be free for the next 36 hours! To redeem it, simply follow the steps below:\n\n1.\tInstall [Yata](https://apps.apple.com/app/yata-yet-another-to-do-app/id1631370175) from the App Store\n2.\tOpen Yata.\n3.\tNavigate to the **Settings** tab on iPhone, or through the **(...)** more button in the sidebar on iPad.\n4.\tTap the banner at the top of the page to present the paywall.\n5.\tTap **\"All Plans\"** at the bottom-left, and select the **\"Lifetime\"** option.\n6.\tIf the deal has not expired, the price should be **$0.00**. Tap **\"Continue\"** to complete the purchase.\n\nPlease note that the IAP is only accessible on the iPhone and iPad apps.\n\nIf you are new to Yata, I've included parts of my previous post below to provide more details about the app:\n\n  \n\\---\n\n\n\n# Why should I try Yet Another Todo App?\n\nInstead of listing all the features you’d expect from a todo app (yes, it has lists/projects/tags/subtasks, natural language processing, shortcuts integration, interactive widgets, iCloud sync, and all that jazz), here’s what I think makes Yata unique:\n\n🗓️ **Unified Calendar**: View and manage your todos and calendar events in one place with the integrated Calendar view. You can manage your time at various resolutions by switching between the **List, Day, 3-Day, 5-Day, Week, and Month views**. You can also easily make plans and adapt to changes with intuitive drag and drop gestures to reschedule items on the Calendar.\n\n🎨 **Theming**: Yata takes theming to a new level, offering an intuitive and delightful experience for exploring, customising, and managing various aesthetics to make the app uniquely yours. Yata allows you to **customise the colours used throughout the app**, including the widgets!\n\n📥 **Captures**: Unlike many apps in this space, Yata allows you to **create, store and manage non-actionable items**. This encourages you to capture your thoughts in an unfiltered manner, without the cognitive burden of fleshing out the thought in the moment or the psychological effect of having \"incomplete\" tasks that aren’t actually completable.\n\n\n\n# Aren’t you going to be sherlock-ed soon?\n\nWhile it is true that the built-in Calendar app will integrate Reminders and Events in iOS 18, I believe Yata still offers significant advantages over the native option:\n\n* **Duration:** Unlike Reminders, Yata allows you to set a duration for your tasks, providing a more detailed time management approach.\n* **Differentiate Intent and Due Dates:** Reminders only support a single date/time, making it hard to distinguish between when you want to do a task and its actual deadline. Yata supports both intent and due dates, giving you greater flexibility in planning.\n* **Day Templates:** Yata's Routines feature allows you to create customisable day templates that can be easily loaded into your schedule to avoid repetitive setup and save time.\n\nWhile these missing features might still be acceptable for many users, I hope that you will consider giving Yata a try, especially since it offers a generous free tier and an inexpensive lifetime option!\n\n\n\n# Pricing\n\nYata offers a generous free tier and an inexpensive lifetime option.

        "content": "## Geekbench 6 CPU scores\n\n* M4 6e/4p/10g: 15 115\n* M4 Pro 4e/8p/16g: 20 472\n* M4 Pro 4e/10p/20g: 22 850\n* M4 Max 4e/10p/32g: 23 137\n* M4 Max 4e/12p/40g: 26 482\n\n## Analysis of CPU scores\n\n* M4 6e/4p/10g: 1 512 score per core\n* M4 Pro 4e/8p/16g: **1 706 score per core**\n* M4 Pro 4e/10p/20g: 1 632 score per core\n* M4 Max 4e/10p/32g: 1 653 score per core\n* M4 Max 4e/12p/40g: 1 655 score per core\n\nWhen going from M4 to 12-core M4 Pro, we are adding p-cores and removing e-cores and thus the increase to score per core is justified. When going from the 12-core M4 Pro to any higher-tier chip, we are again adding p-cores but the score per core decreases, indicating diminishing returns (you would expect the score per core to increase because the e-core / p-core ratio is changing in favor of p-cores). The only explanation for this I have is that either the p-cores in 12-core M4 Pro can be pushed to higher clocks due to thermal/wattage headroom, or the higher tier chips start hitting some kind of thermal/wattage constraints, i.e. they are throttling or they are power starved.\n\n~~Another way to look at this is that by going from 10-core M4 to 12-core M4 Pro, you are adding 2 p-cores (33% increase in p-core count for a total of 8 p-cores) and getting additional 35% multicore CPU performance. By going to 14-core M4 Pro and adding 2 more p-cores (25% increase in p-core count for a total of 10 p-cores), you are getting only additional 11.6% multicore CPU performance. That's a huge discrepancy. The M4 Max upgrade adds 2 more p-cores (20% increase in p-core count for a total of 12 p-cores) and yields additional 14.5% multicore CPU performance, which is still less than expected but not nearly as bad. **Going from 12-core to 14-core M4 Pro is the least efficient upgrade of the entire M4 series.**~~\n\nRemoved the above section because I didn't realize base M4 has 6e/4p and assumed it has 4e/6p.\n\n## Geekbench 6 GPU scores (Metal)\n\n* M4 6e/4p/10g: 58 242\n* M4 Pro 4e/8p/16g: 99 764\n* M4 Pro 4e/10p/20g: 112 606\n* M4 Max 4e/10p/32g: 160 893\n* M4 Max 4e/12p/40g: 193 730\n\n## Analysis of the GPU scores\n\n* M4 6e/4p/10g: 5 824 score per core\n* M4 Pro 4e/8p/16g: **6 235 score per core**\n* M4 Pro 4e/10p/20g: 5 630 score per core\n* M4 Max 4e/10p/32g: 5 028 score per core\n* M4 Max 4e/12p/40g: 4 843 score per core\n\nThe story here repeats. Going from 10g M4 to 16g M4 Pro adds 60% more cores but yields 71% more score. The disproportional increase can be explained by the increased memory bandwidth from 120 GB/s to 273 GB/s on the Pro chip. So, all is good here.\n\nGoing from 16g M4 Pro to 20g M4 Pro adds 25% more GPU cores but yields only 13% more score. The memory bandwidth stays the same, so you would expect 25% more GPU cores to give you roughly 25% more performance, but instead you get only 13% - massive diminishing returns. This could again be some kind of thermal/wattage constraint.\n\nNone of the Max chips can reach the 6 235 score per GPU core, in fact the higher up you go, the less GPU score per core you are getting. So proportionally, the 12-core M4 Pro wins again.\n\n## If I am getting M4 Pro, should I go for the 12-core or the 14-core variant?\n\nFor $200 more, you are getting:\n\n* 0% more single-core CPU performance\n* 0% more memory bandwidth\n* 0 additional RAM options (the same 24 GB or 48 GB on MBP)\n* 11.6% more multi-core CPU performance\n* 13% more GPU performance\n\nBy looking at [this excellent chart](https://old.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/1gl3ora/all_m_series_geekbench_scores_multicore_cpu_metal/), you can see that the base M4 has comparable multi-core CPU performance to M2 Pro. If you do some math, the inter-generational performance gains are about 20 - 25% per generation (year) on average, so far. If this trend continues, the base M6 will be on par with the M4 Pro. The 11.6% extra CPU will make a little difference in that regard because it will be vastly overshadowed by the inter-generational gains.\n\nAnother way to look at this: if you had M1 Mac right now, and someone offered you to wave a magic wand and increase your multi-core CPU by 11.6%, or instead give you $200 towards the purchase of a new M4 Mac, which one would you take? I am on a 6 years old Intel MacBook right now. If someone offered me 11.6% more performance for $200, I would laugh in their face. The 12-core to 14-core M4 Pro upgrade might look tempting today, but in reality it is buying you only half a generation of headroom.\n\nYou might also say, if I am getting a $2000 MacBook Pro, the extra $200 is 11.6% more multi-core CPU performance and 13% more GPU performance while paying only 10% more. Seems worth it, right? I really applaud Apple for the way they structure their upgrades, it is a top-tier psychological trickery to lead you to cognitive errors. It is the whole laptop that costs $2000, not the 12-core M4 Pro. If you were building a desktop computer for $2000, a top-tier desktop gaming CPU might retail for like $400 out of the entire thing. Paying $200 to upgrade that CPU is 50% more and that makes no sense if you are getting only 11.6% more CPU multi-core performance. On another note, the A18 Pro in iPhone 16 Pro costs Apple $45 to make. The M4 Pro is certainly a different beast, but I guess it can cost Apple up to $200 to make (probably less). A $200 upgrade would be paying 100% more in that case.\n\n## TL;DR\n\nFrom all of the M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, the 12-core M4 Pro is at the peak of the performance curve. All the upper tier chips have diminishing returns. If you are getting M4 Pro and want the best bang for your buck, get the 12-core CPU one.\n\n## Workload-specific tips\n\nDo note that some creative apps (I believe in the sound/music industry) run on p-cores and avoid e-cores. In that case, the 4 e-cores will run idle, leaving more thermal/wattage room for additional 2 p-cores you could be running in the 14-core M4 Pro variant vs the 12-core M4 Pro. It is possible that in these specific workloads you could be looking at a substantial performance imporovement. If you use specialized apps like that, better check out some benchmarks specific to your use-case.\n\n[VMs actually only ever use p-cores.](https://eclecticlight.co/2023/10/23/how-does-macos-manage-virtual-cores-on-apple-silicon/) Docker on macOS runs a background VM so it's the same thing. VMs do not get any kind of exclusivity over the CPU cores though, each vCPU is basically a high priority thread that macOS schedules to run on p-cores. In the case of 12-core vs 14-core M4 Pro, you will benefit from the 2 extra p-cores only in situations where you saturate the first 8 p-cores. So, if you run some heavy workloads on your VMs and max out all the 8 p-cores, then having the 2 extra p-cores will help a bit to push the performance even further. Additionally, if your e-cores are idle during that time, there should be thermal/wattage room that might broaden the performance delta between 12-core vs 14-core variant (benchmarks tend to max out all e-cores and p-cores at the same time). I run VMs and Docker too but I see no benefit of the 14-core M4 Pro because I never run workloads that could possibly max out all 8 p-cores at the same time.\n\n## Update: Real-world comparisons between 12-core and 14-core M4 Pro\n\n* [Gaming - Andrew Tsai](https://youtu.be/UNjOWY21qP4?t=435) - 9% to 12% better performance despite having 25% more GPU cores",

Here’s a look at my setup and why I went this route.\n\n\n\n**My Setup:**\n\n\n\n\t•\t**MacBook Pro 14” M1** – main device\n\n\t•\t**Mac Mini (M4 base model)** – handles coding and heavy tasks\n\n\t•\t**MacBook 12”** –just for testing\n\n\t•\t**Network Splitter / mac mini 2014** – hardwired to the new M4 Mac Mini to improve connectivity (Hotspot is limiting the function on the device which shares the internet)\n\n\n\nTheoretically, I could link up to *nine screens* by adding multiple displays to each Mac. (Not tested—my budget isn’t that wild! 😅)  \n  \n  \n  \nI had the pain questions:  \nif I buy the M4 Pro Mac mini, I could buy 3 base models... is this worth it?\n\nMy work doesnt need it right now and I brought the base Model, so I cvan sell it later or add another Mac mini (base or even m4 pro if i really need that juice)\n\n\n\n**Why I Built This Setup:**\n\n\n\n\t1.\t**Offloading Work**: My MacBook Pro was hitting memory limits, but the cost of a 64GB upgrade was out of reach. I went with multiple Macs instead for efficient task distribution.\n\n\t2.\t**Cost vs. Power**: Rather than one powerful device, I wanted to see if multiple Macs with Universal Control could replicate the efficiency—and it’s working well so far.\n\n\t3.\t**Focused Workflows**: Each device has a role:\n\n\t•\tMac Mini: Coding, IDEs, Docker\n\n\t•\tMacBook Pro: Browsing, Safari, GPTs etc\n\n\t•\tMacBook 12: 3rd Connetion testunit\n\n**Initial Impressions**\n\n\n\nThis setup is new, but Universal Control makes switching between devices seamless (provided iCloud and Handoff are configured right). I also have Synergy as a backup, but Apple’s integration is definitely smoother.\n\n\n\n**Downsides**\n\n\n\nThe only downside is that I can’t combine all the power into one task, but this setup offloads work efficiently. Plus, the modularity of using multiple devices is oddly satisfying.\n\n\n\n**TL;DR**: Tried a 3-Mac setup with Universal Control to distribute tasks and save on costs. Anyone else experimenting with setups like this? Its crazy.\n\n[Susu just got her first MacBook!](https://preview.redd.it/o3ibi8ptk30e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2ac3209f7b3da4c7838a39bd7471b699990c3b93)\n\n",

        "content": "I have a home office in which I do primarily writing work, though I'm beginning to do more with photography and audio/video editing. I have a 2019 MBA 13\" (Intel i5, 16GB RAM, 512GD SSD) which is running quite slow with a Dell 4K UHD external monitor hooked up to it; to be honest, it runs slow even when used without peripherals. The SSD is nearly full, which could well be part of the problem. The MBA also often has trouble waking from sleep, etc. Other peripherals include a webcam, Keychron keyboard, wired mouse, external HD, and occasional others.\n\nGiven all the cables hooked up to the MBA at my desk, I used an ancient 11-inch MBA (2014, maybe? and no longer OS-updatable) when I traveled cross-country recently.\n\nMany of the apps I use for my work can be cross-platform, but at least one important piece of software I need is MacOS only, so I'm sticking to Apple products for now.\n\nI have a small budget (\\~ $1000-1500) to upgrade my tech. I'm thinking about going with a Mac Mini to use at my desk, and then using my 2019 MBA as an actual laptop when I'm working outside the office. I also have an iPad Mini 6 that I use frequently, though that's mostly to read books and play games.\n\nWhat hardware solution would you suggest? Is Mac Mini the way to go (and which one)? Should I look at a new laptop instead? Thanks for your help!\n\n  \nETA: I'm hoping to make a purchase during the upcoming Black Friday / Cyber Monday sales. (Does Apple participate in those? Am I better off buying through Best Buy or elsewhere?)",

        "content": "Hi there,\n\nMy wife and I run a small business from home - we both have M1 Macbook Pros. We'd love a way to access the same file storage on our network, and have that storage space be Google Drive. That way everything is synced and kept up to date.  So if im downloading a file online for work, I can save it straight down onto the Mac Mini synced Google Drive space, and not into my local Download files which is a blackhole.\n\nWe use Google Workspace so sadly Google Drive is non negotiable for the cloud space.\n\nWill this 2014 Mac Mini fit the bill and be somewhat future proof from being \"invisible\" to our M1 Macs? \n\n  \nMy though process:\n\n1. Setup the 2014 Mac Mini has an accessible storage space on our home network\n2. Install Google Drive for Desktop on that Mac Mini\n3. Add that Mac Mini as a findable drive on our M1 macbook pros (via wifi). \n4. Use the Mac Mini as our central place to save all our client work etc.\n\nOpen to suggestions on better workflow - here is the Mac Mini I was looking at! We're on a budget so these fancy $2000 network setups are a bit overkill for us.\n\n[https://uk.webuy.com/product-detail?id=SDESAPPMM7102B&categoryName=DESKTOPS-APPLE-MAC&superCatName=COMPUTING&title=&queryID=99B35994F715002797849A4F3586004C&position=3](https://uk.webuy.com/product-detail?id=SDESAPPMM7102B&categoryName=DESKTOPS-APPLE-MAC&superCatName=COMPUTING&title=&queryID=99B35994F715002797849A4F3586004C&position=3)",

        "content": "So earlier this year I bought a MacBook Air 2020 M1  8gb RAM 256gb (my first Mac computer ever) off a friend of a friend for $250 (really sweet deal less than 50 charging cycles if I recall). I mainly bought it to help the dude out, but also because I love to edit my photographs using Lightroom and figured I would give it a shot as before I was only using my iPad Air M1 which I was finding was pretty decent in itself. I really liked the hot keys and the desktop app is just a bit more intuitive. For context, I had my MacBook Air hooked up to my 4k monitor and I never take it on the go anywhere, I reserve that for my iPad. Anywho I really liked how Lightroom worked on the MacBook only caveat is that you can very much tell the 8gb of ram was holding it back, which kind of tickled my brain trying to tell me it would be sweet if I can upgrade. \n\nThen I saw Mac mini M4, figured I only use my Air docked, and the 16gb of ram would be a boost; and that a potential trade in for my 2020 air + the education pricing put my total out of pocket at $161. Pulled the trigger, and now I am here sitting with my assumptions being realized now typing on my Mac mini M4. \n\n  \nNow for my question... kind of second guessing my decision to send in my MacBook Air 2020 M1 for trade in. I got it for so cheap ($250) and the trade in value after inspection is expected to be $350. Obviously I would not use it docked probably ever again, but I think now that it is not my primary device I would maybe consider it being a travel device? Again might be redundant in that sense too because I have my iPad Air M1 and can even use Lightroom in a pinch for that too.\n\n  \nJust curious what you guys, think or what you guys would do. ",

        "content": "Hi,\n\nI need an Excel sheet that can calculate taxes related to ETF / Stock investments.\n\nThere should be a page for buying activity and another for selling activity. The tax calculation should use the First In First Out (FIFO) principle. For example, if I've bought 10 ETFs (like QQQ) on the first day of the month,  bought 3 more 5 days later, sold 7 ETFs 10 days later and sold 5 more 4 days later, my gains should be calculated by considering these dates (the profit/loss from the second sale of 5 ETFs should be calculated by substrcting the first 3 from the first buying price, but the remaining 2 from the second buying price). Also, my local government requires everything to be calculated in our local currency, so the buying and selling prices should first be converted to their value in local currency at the dates when the buying and selling activities have been performed).\n\nHow much of this activity can be performed on Excel and can it be automated to check for currency rates at the specific dates?\n\n  \nThanks...",
