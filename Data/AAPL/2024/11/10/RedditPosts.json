Tech research firm Tech Insights had taken apart the product, revealing the TSMC chip and apparent violation of export controls.\n\nHuawei, at the center of the U.S. action, is on a restricted trade list, which requires suppliers to obtain licenses to ship any goods or technology to the company. Any license that could aid Huawei's AI efforts would likely be denied.\n\nTSMC suspended shipments to China-based chip designer Sophgo after its chip matched the one found on the Huawei AI processor, sources told Reuters last month.\n\nReuters could not determine how the chip ended up on Huawei's Ascend 910B, released in 2022, viewed as the most advanced AI chip available from a Chinese company.\n\nThe latest clampdown hits many more companies and will allow the U.S. to assess whether other companies are diverting chips to Huawei for its AI processor.\n\nAs a result of the letter, TSMC notified affected clients that it was suspending shipments of chips starting Monday, the person said.\nThe Commerce Department declined comment.\n\nA spokesperson for TSMC also declined to comment beyond saying it was a \"law-abiding company...committed to complying with all applicable rules and regulations, including applicable export controls.\"\n\nThe Commerce Department communication -- known as an \"is informed\" letter -- allows the U.S. to bypass lengthy rule-writing processes to quickly impose new licensing requirements on specific companies.\n\nIjiwei, a Chinese media site covering the semiconductor industry, reported on Friday that TSMC notified Chinese chip design companies it would suspend 7 nanometer or below chips for AI and GPU customers beginning Nov. 11.\n\nThe action comes as both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have raised concerns about the inadequacy of export controls on China and the Commerce Department's enforcement of them.\n\nIn 2022, the Commerce Department sent is-informed letters to Nvidia and AMD restricting their ability to export top AI-related chips to China, and to chip equipment makers like Lam Research, Applied Materials and KLA to restrict tools to make advanced chips to China.\n\nThe restrictions in those letters were later turned into rules that apply to companies beyond them.\n\nThe U.S. has been delayed in updating rules on tech exports to China. As Reuters reported in July, the Biden administration drafted new rules on some foreign exports of chipmaking equipment and planned to add about 120 Chinese companies to the Commerce Department's restricted entity list, including chipmaking factories, toolmakers, and related companies.\n\nBut despite plans for an August release, and later tentative target dates for publication, the rules still have not been issued.",

        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1goe5ux/bullish_on_riot_bitcoin_miners/",
        "content": "Let’s face it, prior to a month or two ago, it’s been pretty terrible for the Bitcoin mining industry. Across the board it almost all affected companies were down. RIOT in particular. \n\nBut here’s Why I’m Excited About This Stock. Some of which applies to Bitcoin mining in general. \n\n RIOT is on the move. The stock has surged to $12.64 this week with impressive trading volumes.\n\nKey Points:\n\n1. Massive Mining Infrastructure\n\nRIOT operates some of the largest bitcoin mining facilities in the world, including the Corsicana site (with 600MW still under construction) and Rockdale (700MW). While other miners like IREN are planning large-scale sites, RIOT's operations are already up and running, and they’re far ahead in terms of scale.\n\n2. Bitcoin Price Surge\n\nBitcoin is riding high, currently above $80,000 (and some analysts predict it could hit $100,000 by year-end). RIOT holds over 10,000 BTC, which means as bitcoin prices rise, so does RIOT’s asset base.\n\n3. Future Goals\n\nRIOT’s ambition to hit 100 EH/s by 2027 positions them as a leader in mining hash rate, further boosting their long-term potential.\n\n4. AI Potential\n\nWhat excites me even more is CEO Jason Les mentioning that RIOT is open to AI opportunities. With their massive mining facilities in Texas—close to key urban centers like Austin and Dallas, with access to cheap power and low latency—they’re perfectly positioned to pivot into AI workloads if the right deal comes along. The growing demand for GPUs in AI, paired with RIOT’s vast infrastructure, could make them a key player in this space as well. Jason has already mentioned they have received a lot of interest in this direction.\n\n5. Political & Market Factors\n\nWith Trump returning to office, there could be major benefits for U.S.-based miners. Increased support for domestic bitcoin mining and the likelihood of regulatory changes to ease production could propel bitcoin—and in turn, RIOT—to new highs. As bitcoin rises, so does RIOT's profitability.\n\nThe Big Picture:\nI’m not claiming RIOT is the only player to watch, but they’re certainly one of the biggest and in a strong position. With bitcoin price potentially reaching $100,000 in the near future, we could see RIOT’s stock easily hit $20-$25 by the end of the year, and $50+ if the market conditions continue to favor them.",

I'm using Schwab's screener on my laptop and it works fine, but I already spend enough time sitting down at a computer. I've tried searching Google Play for screener apps, but they're all aimed at traders and/or have a subscription fee that I can't justify paying. The Schwab mobile app unfortunately doesn't have a screener.\n\nMy definition of \"cheap\": Doesn't require a $5+ monthly fee for something I can do for free on my laptop. I'm not opposed to paying, especially if it's a one time purchase and the UI is great.",
