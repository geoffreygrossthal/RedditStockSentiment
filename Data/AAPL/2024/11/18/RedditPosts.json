Their recent job posting for a Director of AI Engineering focuses on integrating Generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs) into existing systems, rather than building proprietary solutions from scratch. This aligns perfectly with SoundHound’s expertise in conversational AI and their dominance in the foodservice sector. Notably, McDonald’s previously ended its AI collaboration with IBM, leaving room for a more specialized partner to enhance its drive-thru, kiosk, and mobile ordering systems.\n\nAdding fuel to the speculation, SoundHound recently announced on their earnings call that they’ve secured a major new client in the restaurant industry—one they are not yet able to name and negotiating with others. Given McDonald’s history of partnering with established tech leaders like Dynamic Yield and the timing of this hiring, it’s hard not to connect the dots. If this is indeed a McDonald’s x SoundHound collaboration, it could mark a transformative leap forward in customer experience with cutting-edge conversational AI. I’m expecting an announcement in the next month on who the new logo is and I think it’s pretty likely the largest name in the industry!",

        "content": "The Trump transition team is prioritizing the development of a federal framework for fully self-driving vehicles, aiming to revise current regulations that limit the deployment of autonomous cars without human controls. This move aligns with the interests of Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO and a prominent Trump supporter, who is heavily invested in autonomous technology, including plans to launch driverless Tesla robotaxis by 2026.\n\nCurrent regulations by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) allow only 2,500 self-driving vehicles per year under exemptions, creating barriers for Tesla and other manufacturers aiming for large-scale deployment. The Trump team is exploring leadership options for the Transportation Department, including former Uber executive Emil Michael, to craft policies that could facilitate mass adoption. Bipartisan legislative efforts to increase deployment caps and establish federal rules for autonomous vehicles have faced repeated setbacks, including challenges in Congress and failed compromises during the Biden administration.\n\nMusk, who has been appointed alongside entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead Trump’s \"Department of Government Efficiency,\" is advocating for streamlined regulations and has pledged to push for policies enabling nationwide use of autonomous vehicles. The initiative has raised concerns among rideshare companies like Uber and Lyft, whose stock prices dipped following Musk’s announcements.\n\nThe push reflects broader ambitions to dismantle regulatory hurdles and advance emerging technologies under the Trump administration, though significant legislative and bureaucratic challenges remain.\n\n  \nSource - [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars?embedded-checkout=true](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-17/trump-team-said-to-want-to-ease-us-rules-for-self-driving-cars?embedded-checkout=true)\n\nArchive - [https://archive.is/S9qOq#selection-1391.0-1915.60](https://archive.is/S9qOq#selection-1391.0-1915.60)  \n",

        "content": "NVDA's next-generation Blackwell AI chips had serious overheating issues in high-capacity server racks. These issues have led to design adjustments and program delays, leaving major customers such as Google, Meta and Microsoft concerned about being able to deploy Blackwell servers as planned.\n\nBlackwell GPUs, designed for AI and high-performance computing (HPC), experienced overheating issues in servers configured with 72 processors, which can consume up to 120 kilowatts of power per rack. The overheating issue forced NVIDIA to modify the rack design several times, which not only limited GPU performance but also potentially damaged the hardware. Customers were concerned that these technical issues were delaying processor deployments in data centers.\n\nTo address this challenge, NVIDIA asked suppliers to adjust rack designs and worked with partners to optimize cooling systems. While such engineering improvements are a routine step in large-scale technology releases, they also further delayed product delivery.\n\nI think the overheating issues with the Blackwell chips reflect the technical complexities and challenges in the development of advanced AI hardware, but NVIDIA is responding to these issues with design adjustments and enhanced collaboration. While the delays may have some negative impact on customers and NVIDIA's results in the short term, the Blackwell chips are still expected to be a significant driver of the AI and HPC markets as optimizations are completed and products are shipped at scale.",

        "content": "**1. Valuation Metrics Are Sky-High**  \nPalantir currently trades at a Price-to-Sales (P/S) ratio of approximately 53.13, significantly higher than industry peers.\n\n[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/ps-ratio/PLTR) Even for a growth company, this level of valuation is extreme and implies future growth rates that may be unattainable.\n\n\n\n**2. Revenue Growth Isn’t Scaling as Expected**  \nWhile Palantir’s revenue growth has been solid, it’s showing signs of deceleration:\n\n* FY 2022: 24% year-over-year growth\n* FY 2023 (projected): 18% year-over-year growth\n\nThis deceleration doesn’t justify its premium valuation. Additionally, the company remains heavily reliant on government contracts, which are often lumpy and unpredictable.\n\n**3. Profitability Is Still Questionable**  \nDespite boasting about achieving GAAP profitability recently, Palantir has heavily relied on stock-based compensation (SBC). In fact, SBC accounted for approximately 30% of their operating expenses last quarter, which dilutes shareholder value and raises questions about true profitability.\n\n**4. AI Hype Is Inflating the Bubble**  \nThe market has been overly optimistic about Palantir’s AI capabilities. While their AI Platform (AIP) sounds promising, actual adoption metrics and revenue contribution from AIP remain vague. It’s easy to talk AI; it’s harder to monetize it sustainably.\n\n**5. Insider Selling Signals Lack of Confidence**  \nExecutives have been offloading shares at a significant rate. For instance, Chairman Peter Thiel sold a substantial portion of his holdings recently.\n\n[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-lead-sell-palantir-stock-223000919.html)If the leadership team doesn’t see long-term upside at these prices, why should we?\n\n\n\n**6. Competitive Pressure Is Mounting**  \nPalantir operates in a crowded space with competitors like Snowflake ($SNOW), Databricks, and Microsoft ($MSFT) offering similar or better solutions. Palantir’s dependence on government clients limits its commercial reach in comparison.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nPalantir is an interesting company with solid tech, but the stock price is disconnected from fundamentals. High valuations, slowing growth, heavy SBC, and reliance on government contracts make $PLTR a risky bet at current levels. AI hype has driven the price into bubble territory, and insiders don’t seem confident in its future.\n\nWhat do you think? Is $PLTR worth its valuation, or are we seeing another overhyped tech bubble? Let’s discuss! 👇\n\n*Note: All financial figures are based on the latest available data as of November 2024.*\n\nSources",
