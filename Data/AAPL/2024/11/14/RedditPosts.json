        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1grc49j/south_koreas_value_up_program_and_why_korean/",
        "content": "Korean stocks have long been undervalued, referred to as the \"Korean discount\". This is in part due to concerns over North Korea, low dividend payouts/buybacks relative to earnings, difficulty for retail investors to access Korean markets(other than ETFs),governance concerns of \"Chaebol\"(family controlled companies), foreign exchange rate risk, and most recently, tariffs.\n\nThe Korean market has grown increasingly cheaper recently, down 42% from its peak 3 years ago. Right now Korea's stock market is trading below book value(0.96x), compared to the US, which is trading at 4.8x book value.\n\nEarlier this year, South Korea unveiled a voluntary program called \"Value Up\", aimed to address this undervaluation. In addition to a lot of voluntary improvements in disclosures modeled after programs that pushes Japan's market to new highs, the program offers tax credits equal to 5% of the increases in buybacks/dividends. **The government is literally paying companies to buy back their stock**. Meanwhile in the US we tax stock buybacks. \n\nIn addition to these tax incentives to juice stock prices, South Korea has also cut corporate tax rates, cancelled a capital gains tax, and cut inheritance taxes.\n\nThere are some insanely cheap stocks in Korea, some examples:\n\n- SK Hynix, for example, is trading at 8.45x forward earnings. And they're growing very fast due to AI and the need for high speed memory for GPUs/AI chips. You will not find a growing company with AI customers in the US trading below 10x earnings.\n\n- Samsung, the largest company in Korea, is trading at 9x forward earnings. This is despite substantial growth over the past decade. While they do face struggles in their foundry business with their 3 nm process, they are a very diversified business, and still very profitable despite their challenges. If their next process fares better, there is tremendous upside. In comparison, TSMC trades at 23.38x forward earnings, Intel 28.01x.\n\n- Hyundai trades at 2.75x forward earnings, Kia 3.62X. Car companies usually trade at low PE during boom periods due to being cyclical and capital intensive, but to compare, GM has a forward P/E of 5.13, Ford 6.33, Tesla 99.14. So even after adjusting for industry, Korean auto companies are very cheap.\n\nWhen you combine cheap stocks with governments subsidizing dividends/buybacks, high returns seem very probable over the long term.\n\nWith the US market's P/E ratio hitting record highs despite rising bond yields, the Korean market seems like a really strong opportunity for investors concerned with valuations and looking to diversify\n\nPositions: I'm buying a lot of the etf EWY because I can't buy individual securities. I looked at FLKR because it supposedly had a lower Expense ratio, but it has somehow consistently underperformed EWY and has less liquidity, so I went with EWY.",

        "content": "Recently I have been concerned about the dramatic changes in the chip industry, particularly the impact of the explosion in demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips.25 years ago, Intel represented tech companies in the Dow Jones, and today, NVIDIA's shares have soared seven-fold, taking Intel's place as the new blue-chip stock. This shows that the industry's focus has shifted from traditional needs to AI applications.\n\nThere are three main challenges in the industry. First, most chip companies are lagging behind NVIDIA in designing and producing AI chips, with longer lead times as standards improve. Second, Intel is lagging behind TSMC and SK Hynix due to manufacturing delays and underinvestment, especially in the high-end chip market where TSMC's share is even 62%. Finally, high-end AI chips have much higher profit margins than traditional chips, which exacerbates the trend of “winner-take-all”, such as TSMC and SK Hynix's profits and share price have risen sharply, while Samsung and Intel look weak due to poor profits.\n\nI think in today's AI world dominated by Nvidia, global chipmakers may have no choice but to join Nvidia's supply chain if they can't catch up technologically.",

        "content": "Hi, I've been looking for a docking station for my MacBook Pro (M4 Max, 2024), and I'm trying to find out which dock I should buy. I have been looking around, but all I could find is quite pricey, and some meet all my requirements but don't mention anything about being supported on Mac/macOS. My screen I'm trying to connect to is the Samsung 49\" Odyssey OLED G9 G93SC.\n\nMy requirements for the docking station are:\n\n1. The dock has to have Thunderbolt and DisplayPort ports.\n2. The dock has to support the resolution 5120x1440 or higher at 120 or 240Hz and HDR if possible.\n3. The dock must be fully compatible with Mac/macOS and operate reliably.\n4. The dock has to be reasonably priced. However, I would appreciate any recommendations regardless of price.\n\nSo, please, if you have a docking station that meets all these requirements and has worked every day since you bought it with little to no problems at all, please write them in the comments section.\n\nThanks!",

        "content": "Hi !  \nI'm planning on buying an Odyssey G6 32\" G65B to replace my old FHD screen, mainly for my PC setup via Display port.  \nI also have an M3 MacBook Air that I want to connect to it via HDMI that I'm using for music production.  \nSo first question : will it support 240Hz @ 2K or will it be 144Hz (since it's 2.1). \nSecond question : Which dock/hub do you recommend, I'm planning on keeping the Mac lid shut and I'd need at least 1 USB-C/TB + 2 USB-A. The more low-key it is the better. I had my eyes on the Satechi Dual Dock Stand. Would this work ? The NVME enclosure is a plus for me but idk if the HDMI is good for 2K with max refresh rate (says 4K@60Hz).  \nThank you!",

        "content": "Hi all! For reasons, I want to buy an intel MacBook Pro. Wondering which model to buy. Use case is: Daily driver for work / school + occasional light gaming. I intend to dual boot with windows 10. I know I’m probably looking at something in the 2012-2019 range, but interested in other opinions before I grab something. I’ve been scouting on back market, but want to make sense of them. Also, for reference, right now I have the 2017 i5 MacBook Pro that got me through undergrad and I’m *not* happy with it anymore (it has major keyboard and screen issues, and it’s pretty underpowered).",

        "content": "Hi guys, I am trying to finish work on a book I've been writing, but have been procrastinating for YEARS on this and am sick of it. I have 20% of it left to write, and someone suggested buying a computer for very cheap and using it as a workstation (rather than my laptop), not connecting it to the Internet so that I don't get distracted during my writing.\n\nAs a result, I'd like to get an old iMac and pay as little for it as possible (since I'll literally be using Word only and nothing else). I know eBay and FB Marketplace, but does anyone know any resellers that sell safe equipment such as the above that I can be confident purchasing from? It would literally be for using Word and nothing else, so HD space and RAM and all that is not important.\n\nThanks very much for your help in advance.",

        "content": "Hi everyone! \n\n  \nI recently got a mac mini as I've never really had a personal computer and the price was just too hard to say no. My current set up is as follows: an Aorus 42 inch monitor, an Iquinix bluetooth mechanical keyboard, & a logitech G508 mouse. \n\n  \nNormally, I use the work pc as a desktop computer where I close the lid and connect everything via bluetooth. My struggle is that I don't have a good way to switch between the Mac Mini & my work laptop while keeping the same bluetooth mouse & kb. Because the Mac Mini isn't a laptop, if the bluetooth doesn't work I have to grab a cable and directly connect which is a huge pain. \n\n  \nIs there a good way to connect my kb & mouse to the Aorus monitor directly? That way no matter the input device (my work PC or the Mac Mini) I can still use it with the same bluetooth device? Is the best way to just have two keyboards and two mice for each dedicated input? \n\n  \nAny advice is greatly appreciated! ",
