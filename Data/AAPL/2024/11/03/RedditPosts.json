        "content": "Hello, I believe opportunity to beat the market is in finding market ineffectiveness. How much market ineffectiveness do you believe, there is in different information availability between languages?\n\nWhy I am asking.\n\nLast week ČEZ has bought 20% of Rolls Royce SMR. And it was massive event in Czech language. Largest net newspaper had article about it on the front page. (remainder google translate can translate web-pages if you want to read).\n\nLargest newspaper article: https://www.seznamzpravy.cz/clanek/ekonomika-firmy-cez-koupi-za-miliardy-podil-v-rolls-royce-smr-budou-vyrabet-reaktory-263383\n\nState television: https://ct24.ceskatelevize.cz/clanek/domaci/cez-a-rolls-royce-smr-budou-spolupracovat-na-vyvoji-modularnich-reaktoru-354812\n\nWeb about energy industry: https://oenergetice.cz/jaderne-elektrarny/cez-koupi-za-miliardy-podil-v-rolls-royce-smr-budou-spolupracovat-na-reaktorech\n\nWeb about investing: https://www.kurzy.cz/firmy/cez-rolls-royce/\n\neverybody was writing about it. So I thought: I want to see what English speakers think about it. And there was nothing. I bought shares and 1 call. Thinking once they translate the news, market will react. I am already waiting a week. And nothing. When I look at Yahoo finance nothing happened at all. When I look at seeking alpha or IBKR. One simple article, no analysis or discussion.\n\n20% of SMR company has been bought by corporation which has almost monopoly for energy in Czech republic (because it would be illegal to have perfect monopoly). ČEZ talks about need to build up to 10 SMR to replace coal heat/power plants in coming years. ČEZ has recently also bought Škoda JS (Škoda nuclear engineering). That company has produced nuclear reactors in the past. And still has all the tools and facilities to produce nuclear reactors. They have “unused” reactor hall which is currently producing storage units for spent nuclear fuel, because nobody orders reactors today. RR is producing SMR design to be build in factory. ČEZ owns a factory for nuclear reactors in middle of EU. And no one speaks about the synergy. \n\nReaction of the market, whole weak of nothing -1%. As if there were no news. So it got me thinking, how often this happens? Do you know any other example of events which has vastly different information availability or point of view based on language?\n\n*Disclosure: I have 500 shares of RR and 1 RR call, bought this week, and ČEZ shares long term unrelated to this.*",

(I think), I understand futures & options quite well, but don't fully understand leveraged ETPs (exchange traded products), which claim to perform 3X / 5X / 10X of an index or any other underlying e.g. Apple.\n\nSo, let's say I buy such a product, 10X on Apple. If Apple crashes 12%, do I lose **more than** my capital? Here, I'm talking about 12% loss in a day, and not 6+6% over two days, which could lower my investments to near-zero but not zero or negative.\n\nIf I do end up owing money, how's this any different from buying a future?",

        "content": "My take:\n\n**Advantages of Buybacks**\n\n**1. Boosting Share Value**: Buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding, which can increase earnings per share (EPS) and can lead to a higher stock price.\n\nEg: Apple has a series of buybacks for billions of dollars that has benefitted a lot of shareholders.\n\n**2. Boosting Investor Confidence**: Buybacks can boost investor sentiment. Investors interpret it as a sign that the company expects to perform well in the future.  \n\n**Advantages of IPOs**\n\n**1. Growth Potential:** IPOs provide an opportunity to invest in a company at an early stage, potentially reaping substantial rewards as the company grows.\n\n**2. Market Sentiment:** IPOs often attract considerable market attention and investor interest, which can lead to initial price surges.\n\nExample: Paras Defence was listed at a premium of 171% leading to instant gains for buyers in a short time. It does not end here. The share price surged by another 143% within 3 weeks giving more gains to the shareholders.\n\nWhile buybacks are good for existing shareholders as they can sell their shares above the market price, IPOs provide decent prices for retail investors to accumulate shares in case they are able to get allocation for the applied IPO.\n\nWhat do you think about IPOs and buybacks, especially for retail investors?

Like many anglers, we also record our fishing days and catches to look back later and learn from them. A handwritten catch diary has always been a hassle, and the existing apps didn't really convince us. So, we decided to develop our own solution in our free time. After about 7 months of hard work, the first version of LogIT is finally available for iPhones and iPads.\n\n\n\nWhat makes LogIT special?\n\n \\- 📒 Organized diary view instead of chaotic catch lists  \n\n\\- 📊 Visual statistics – Insightful analysis of your catches  \n\n\\- 🖱️ Easy to use and intuitive design  \n\n\\- 🌦️ Automatic logging of weather data  \n\n\\- ☁️ Data backup – iCloud backup and synchronization  \n\n\\- 🚫 No registration required – Start right away, without tedious sign-up processes \n\n\\- ❌ No mandatory subscription  \n\n\\- 🛑 Ad-free – No annoying banners or pop-ups  \n\n\\- 🎨 Customizable color scheme  \n\n\\- 🌙 Dark mode – For comfortable use even at night  \n\n\\- 🐟 Quick recording of bycatches in seconds  \n\n\\- 🔒 No unnecessary data collection – We respect our users' privacy  \n\n\n\n The best part: The lifetime Pro version of LogIT is completely free for 72 hours! We hope the app will become a helpful companion for many anglers. If you are not into fishing but you may know someone who would benefit from a free logbook feel free to share. Numerous updates and new features are already in the pipeline, and we're excited to hear your feedback!\n\n Try out LogIT and let us know what you think. A positive review in the App Store would be a huge motivation boost and the cherry on top! Feel free to share the app with your friends. Thanks in advance.\n\n Tight lines and best wishes, Maik and Daniel 🎣  \n\n P.S. There’s a small bug: On iOS 17, the “Dive in” button doesn’t work sometimes when the app is first launched. However, closing and reopening the app should fix this. There are no issues on iOS 18. A new update is already published and will soon be online.\n\nApp Store link: [https://apps.apple.com/de/app/logit-the-fishing-journal/id6667102943?l=en-GB](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/logit-the-fishing-journal/id6667102943?l=en-GB)",

        "content": "Hello!\n\nI'd like to introduce my first Mac app - **Dreamless**.\n\nThe concept is simple: it automatically turns off Wi-Fi/Bluetooth when your Mac goes to sleep and turns them back on when it wakes up.\n\nYou may wonder why such an app is needed. The answer is simple: it saves your MacBook's battery life, helping keep it in good condition for as long as possible. It also prevents unwanted connections/processes from running without your knowledge when your Mac is asleep.\n\n**Features:**\n\n\\- Ability to toggle Wi-Fi and Bluetooth separately.\n\n\\- All controls are in the menu bar - just two buttons!\n\n\\- Uses minimal resources on your Mac. Overall, the use of system resources is close to zero.\n\n\\- Option to add to auto-start.\n\nWorks on Apple Silicon and Intel. Requires macOS 13+.\n\n**Downsides:**\n\n\\- Despite my efforts to streamline this, due to macOS security, you’ll need to enter your admin password a few times during installation. This isn't to grant access to critical system services but simply to create folders, copy a few essential files, and run the program in the background for proper functionality.\n\n\\- Disabling Wi-Fi may affect the Find My feature.\n\nI use Dreamless daily, both with an external monitor and without any peripherals. With an external monitor, if I wake up my Mac by any means (I use a USB mouse), Bluetooth devices like the keyboard and trackpad connect in a few seconds. Without peripherals, it runs flawlessly.\n\nIn the end, I’ve created a handy utility I've been using for over a year.\n\nFor your safety, the app is signed and notarized, meaning it’s been verified by Apple for malware.\n\nTo celebrate the launch, I’m offering a **75% discount** with the promo code **APPLE**, bringing the price down to just $1. The promo code will be valid for a month, until December 3rd. All future updates will be free.\n\nCheck out the app here: [https://dreamless.app](https://dreamless.app). \n\nI’d love to hear your feedback.\n\nThanks for your attention, and have a great day.",
