I follow trends (death/angel crosses on moving averages, usually enter after a pullback/retest), never predict, always react.\n\n2. OCO always. With a firm take profit, and trailing stop loss I manually adjust. I always progressively move my stop loss first to breakeven, then to arbitrary higher levels to secure my wins and keep losses small.\n\nMy average win rate is 27%, calculated over nearly a year of day trading so fairly reliable. I target 130%+ gains on 0DTE SPY options, and set my stop losses at -13%. \n\nLet me know your thoughts! Or questions. Will keep you updated next week as I can already see the “beginners luck” comments coming lol",
