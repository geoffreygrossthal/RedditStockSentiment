        "content": "\nThis week they launched the Hearing Aid feature, which lets AirPods essentially double up as listening devices plus hearing aids; at a fraction of conventional aids. Assuming it works as Apple claims, this is a crazy opportunity for them to disrupt a legacy market that is so rooted in tradition that I didn't even know could be disrupted. A successful product would mean a durable revenue stream in an increasingly comprehensive wearables portfolio for years to come. Bonus points, it's Apple's first real consumer product innovation in years.\n\nYet, the stock closed nearly flat on Monday (its launch event day); and I would attribute most of the week's gain to broader cycles rather than anything directly related to the company's fundamentals. My guess would be that Apple/market had pinned its entire Glowtime event on AI integration with the iPhone, tbh it wasn't that spectacular and this might have overshadowed the hearing aids announcement.\n\nDoes anyone see what I am seeing, or am I missing something here?\n",
