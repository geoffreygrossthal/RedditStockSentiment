        "content": "Quick glance at some of the numbers for META. That EPS is crazy good, going back to the good times of 2021 all over again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Market Cap|$1,193,404,268,544|\n|:-|:-|\n|Return on Assets|17%|\n|Yield|0.43%|\n|Beta (1Yr, Daily)|1.737|\n|Gross Profit Margin (ttm)|80.8%|\n|FCF to Equity|28.6%|\n|Price to Sales|7.63|\n|Price to Gross Profit|9.45|\n|Price to Book|6.72|\n|Basic EPS (ttm)|15.2|\n|P/E|30.8|\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGOOG, MSFT, AAPL are trading at good prices, but META is a more attractive investment option, imo. AVGO is also another good option although not part of the Mag 7, yes or no?\n\nAMZN, NVDA, and TSLA are excluded due to their high prices. Despite the sky high price, NVDA is a better pick compared to AMZN or TSLA, imo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThese are my thoughts. What do you think? Love to hear your comments.",
