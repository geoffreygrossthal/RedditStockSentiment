Before today, the Dow was the last of the 3 major U.S. large-cap indices with less (relatively speaking) concentration in tech. “Big Tech” now makes up 30% of the S&P 500 and even more of the NASDAQ-100.\n\nThe Dow Jones now includes 3 of the 6 companies (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon) usually considered as Big Tech, plus cloud software provider Salesforce, as well as 3 legacy tech companies (IBM, Intel, Cisco.) That‘s a lot of exposure to tech.\n\nRelatively few 401k providers offer alternatives such as S&P 500 equally-weighted ETFs.",
