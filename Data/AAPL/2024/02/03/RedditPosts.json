I had very good success being profitable 90% of the time then I lost $8000 dollars all in one day from a very bad trade where I kept averaging down and it just never went my way. I know I should’ve had a stop loss and I know that I messed up really bad and it’s completely my fault. I don’t know where to go from here, do I keep trading or just call it quits? Either way i’m grateful for this journey and I have learned a lot but i’m in need of good advice.",
