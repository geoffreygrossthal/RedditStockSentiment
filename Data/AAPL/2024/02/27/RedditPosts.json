The decision was shared by Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and Kevin Lynch, a vice president in charge of the effort, according to the people.\n\nThe two executives told staffers that the project will begin winding down and that many employees on the team working on the car — known as the Special Projects Group, or SPG — will be shifted to the artificial intelligence division under executive John Giannandrea. Those employees will focus on generative AI projects, an increasingly key priority for the company.\n\nThe Apple car team also has several hundred hardware engineers and car designers. It’s possible that they will be able to apply for jobs on other Apple teams. There will be layoffs, but it’s unclear how many.\n\nApple, based in Cupertino, California, declined to comment.\n\nThe decision to ultimately wind down the project is a bombshell for the company, ending a multibillion-dollar effort that would have vaulted Apple into a whole new industry. The tech giant started working on a car around 2014, setting its sights on a fully autonomous electric vehicle with a limousine-like interior and voice-guided navigation.\n\nBut the project struggled nearly from the start, with Apple changing the team’s leadership and strategy several times. Lynch and Williams took over the undertaking a few years ago — following the departure of Doug Field, now a senior executive at Ford Motor Co.\n\nThe decision to wind down the project was finalized by Apple’s most senior executives in recent weeks, according to the people. It comes just a month after Bloomberg News reported that the project reached or a make-or-break point. The most recent approach discussed internally was delaying a car release until 2028 and reducing self-driving specifications from Level 4 to Level 2+ technology.\n\nMost recently, Apple had imagined the car being priced at around $100,000. But executives were concerned about the vehicle being able to provide the profit margins that Apple typically enjoys on its products. The company’s board was also concerned about continuing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on a project that may never see the light of day.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsources;\n\n[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai-1.2039986](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai-1.2039986)\n\n[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-27/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai?srnd=homepage-canada](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-27/apple-cancels-work-on-electric-car-shifts-team-to-generative-ai?srnd=homepage-canada)\n\n[https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project/)\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/apple-car-project-canceled-report.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/apple-car-project-canceled-report.html)\n\n[https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project-titan/](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-electric-car-project-titan/)\n\n[https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-apple-car-project-moves-team-to-generative-ai-projects/](https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/27/apple-cancels-apple-car-project-moves-team-to-generative-ai-projects/)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-cancels-work-ev-moves-staff-ai-project-bloomberg-reports-2024-02-27/](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-cancels-work-ev-moves-staff-ai-project-bloomberg-reports-2024-02-27/)\n\n[https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/apple-electric-car-cancel-2000-workers-ai/](https://fortune.com/2024/02/27/apple-electric-car-cancel-2000-workers-ai/)\n\n[https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/apple-cancels-electric-car-generative-ai-1235924288/](https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/apple-cancels-electric-car-generative-ai-1235924288/)\n\n[https://www.macworld.com/article/2249497/apple-car-project-canceled-generative-ai.html](https://www.macworld.com/article/2249497/apple-car-project-canceled-generative-ai.html)\n\n[https://www.techradar.com/vehicle-tech/hybrid-electric-vehicles/apple-is-done-with-building-an-apple-car-according-to-a-report-and-everything-ive-been-telling-you-for-the-last-nine-years](https://www.techradar.com/vehicle-tech/hybrid-electric-vehicles/apple-is-done-with-building-an-apple-car-according-to-a-report-and-everything-ive-been-telling-you-for-the-last-nine-years)\n\n[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/technology/personaltech/apple-ends-electric-car-plan.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/27/technology/personaltech/apple-ends-electric-car-plan.html)\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/apple-car-project-canceled-ced2b626](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/apple-car-project-canceled-ced2b626)\n\nhttps://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-cancellation-of-car-effort-boosts-urgency-of-bets-on-ai-headset-1.2040140",

        "content": "Make your own conclusions.  \n\n\nI Google'd \"AAPL stock\" to see how it was doing, and the first news link was from \"The Motley Fool\" titled *\"Warren Buffett Sells Apple Shares. Should You Follow His Lead?\"* ([link](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/02/26/warren-buffett-sells-apple-shares-should-you-follo/)). As an investor in the AAPL stock, I was a bit concerned and wanted to check the article out.\n\nThe article mentions that \"Berkshire Hathaway sold some AAPL shares\". This made me actually go look at the form 13F to see what \"some\" means.  \n\n\nIn the Q4 2023 13F, Berkshire Hathaway owned 905,560,000 shares of AAPL. ([source](https://13f.info/13f/000095012324002518-berkshire-hathaway-inc-q4-2023))  \nIn the Q3 2023 13F, they owned 915,560,382 shares of AAPL. ([source](https://13f.info/13f/000095012323011029-berkshire-hathaway-inc-q3-2023-restatement))  \n\n\nThis means, \"some\" equals 1.092%.  \n\n\nAlso, AAPL still accounts for 50.19% of their total investment portfolio, down from 50.04% compared to the previous filing which is a 0.29% relative decrease.",
