        "content": "It’s a tale as old as time, or at least a tale as old as the stock market. \n\n“If only I invested 1000 dollars in apple when I first bought that iPod back in 2005.”\n\n“If only I invested in Netflix when i first subscribed!”\n\n“If only I bought Google shares when I first googled something.”\n\n“If only I bought dominos shares the first time I ordered dominos.”\n\nEvery few months I find myself having these thoughts. And I am trying to become more and more aware of this during my day to day life. Often times if you use a product and love it, it is a pretty solid investment. \n\nI have tried this approach the past few years and it has been successful. I bought Etsy shares when I first started to use Etsy. I bought Celsius shares when I first started drinking Celsius. Also, got some planet fitness stock when I first started going there on a regular basis. \n\nI have been keeping an eye out for the next product that I use everyday, but would love to hear about other peoples. What product have you recently started using everday that you love?\n\nIt can be a device, a subscription, a restaurant, clothing. You name it.  \n\nWould love to know what everyone has to say!\n\nEdit: So far, very few people have actually listed something they recently started using everyday and love. \n\nLet’s think hard and actually try to answer my question, folks.
