        "content": "We all know the stocks and assets that have gone to the moon since the last decade or so. Big tech, Tesla, Bitcoin, NVDA, AMD, and many others. I remember trading msft around 50.00 share in 2015ish thinking this is a boring old PC company lol. \n\nWhile those stocks are still growing and going up they’re now discovered and mature in the cycle. What are some stocks that you think are at the beginning of the cycle that could set sail like the others we all know by now. The proverbial MSFTs at 50.00 or FB at ipo. And why do you see these as something we’ll see explode over the next decade?",
