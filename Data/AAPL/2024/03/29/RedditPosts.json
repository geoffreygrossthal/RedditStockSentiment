        "content": "Needing some advice, I am currently using barchart with its indicator tools to monitor trends and price action for $SPY. I'm wondering if there is something else similar but updates on prices faster. I've noticed barchart lags a bit and I feel that every second counts. This has helped me with trends and swings but I feel like I have to exit out of my trades a few seconds early before they go south. This of course helps me lock gains as I'm being cautious. I just want to try to optimize my timing if I can",
