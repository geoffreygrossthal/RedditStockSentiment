        "content": "Make it make sense people. \n\nIt blows my mind. Amazon and Google are power houses with some of the greatest company “moats” I’ve ever seen. Nvidia is definitely dominating their market but it sure doesn’t seem they have nearly the diversified portfolio these other heavy weights do. Or the protection from another company catching up. \n\nGoogle (search, cloud, mobile, YouTube, software, AI, advertising, consumer electronics, etc.) and Amazon (e-commerce, cloud, Prime, advertising, subscriptions, grocery, consumer electronics, etc)\n\nIt’s just crazy to me. Happy Friday folks. ",
