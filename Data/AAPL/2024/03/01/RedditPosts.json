        "content": "Make it make sense people. \n\nIt blows my mind. Amazon and Google are power houses with some of the greatest company “moats” I’ve ever seen. Nvidia is definitely dominating their market but it sure doesn’t seem they have nearly the diversified portfolio these other heavy weights do. Or the protection from another company catching up. \n\nGoogle (search, cloud, mobile, YouTube, software, AI, advertising, consumer electronics, etc.) and Amazon (e-commerce, cloud, Prime, advertising, subscriptions, grocery, consumer electronics, etc)\n\nIt’s just crazy to me. Happy Friday folks. ",

In true regard fashion, I am diamond handing my calls through next week in case it goes another 20-30% like ARM or SMCI.\n\nCheck my post history for previous plays… ARM -> COIN -> NVDA/QQQ -> DELL\n\nAnd before you tell me to stop being a regard and put my shit into some safe stocks or whatever… this amount doesn’t materially change my life. Now if I run this into a 7 figure account, then maybe it’s a different story. So yea, I’m gonna keep going FULL REGARD. 🫡",
