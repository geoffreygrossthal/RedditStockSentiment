        "content": "Apple is once again entering a new market with patience and looking at the problem from a human perspective, not simply focusing on harnessing and optimizing the underlying technology (which they also do well, obv).\n\nWith ReALM, they are approaching the problem in two key ways: \n\n* Build a model that outperforms ChatGPT 4, others, substantially. \n* Provide a more natural way of interacting with AI based agents\n\nThe second point is the most compelling, and we begin to see Apple's strategy play out. Essentially what they are doing is building an ever present awareness on their devices of what customers are doing on screen. So for example, if you have an iPad, MacBook Pro, and iPhone, Apple's future devices equipped with AI will be aware and processing everything, including screen activities but also as well potentially listening or even seeing what is going on around you. \n\nThis is interesting for two reasons: \n\n1. Apple will ship a decentralized, on device AI processing power and model. Since it's on device, it will naturally be faster and more secure\n2. The multi modality of the interactions opens up a tremendous amount of new use cases for AI in every day life. The new tech will also lay the foundation for other agents and devices (see they are now trying to build robots)\n\nFor companies like Microsoft and OpenAI, they have the models, they have the software, but Apple has YOU. They are easily the most well positioned to build and sell a whole new generation of technology built upon this idea, and I have no doubt they are going to end up being a huge player in the AI race. \n\nCheck out this video for a bit more [information](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EprvbwicLMY&t=669s).",
