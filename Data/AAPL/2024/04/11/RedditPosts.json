        "content": "Hi there, Investing! \n\nI am a first time poster, and I’m wondering how you all overcame the urge to look at your portfolios and check in on them multiple times per day. \n\nI’ve got all my investments tied up in managed accounts, so I don’t actually make the investment choices (aside from setting goals or specific requests). I’ve read that the sentiment with a lot of investors is to just let things play out in the background (to an extent).\n\nI’ve got on-demand access to all of this information on my phone — I can see *everything* with the click of a button in five seconds. I end up checking in on things multiple times per day. So, I’m wondering if: a) this is still the general sentiment, and b) if it is, how you all developed the self-discipline to not check multiple times per day. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice or words of wisdom? \n\nThanks! \n",
