My results aren't typical. Because I spent few years to learn how the market works, and when to enter and exit. I did have losses which you can see DNUT and INTC calls.\n\nFor last week post link\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bxgcmd/15k_to_51k_in_5_days_with_5_trades_do_i_know/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button\n\n",
