        "content": "Almost a year after acquiring TD , I still don't like it. I hate their phone app.  it is awful too many steps to do one thing.\n\n\n\nDo you have suggestions of a brokerage with a user friendly, easy phone app?\n\n\n.I don't like fidelity too. \n\n\nMy other question is If I want to transfer my account from SC to a different brokerage in the future, do they do selling of my account holdings first and then buy with current price? Or are they gonna just transfer same quantity and cost bases ?\n\n\nTIA\n\n",
