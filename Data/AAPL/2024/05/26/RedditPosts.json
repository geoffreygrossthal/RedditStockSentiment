        "content": "Currently Nvidia has a market cap of 2.62T, making it the 3rd largest market cap company in US. This follows Microsoft at 3.19T and Apple at 2.91T. If Nvidia were to become #1 in market cap, which looks like that's going to happen soon, that would be about 22% increase in its stock price. But beyond that, how realistic is it for this company to keep growing up to 4T market cap and beyond? Are the prospects seriously that good? To hit 4T, Nvidia stock would need to rise by another 50%. I just can't see how that is going to happen. How can Nvidia, which really is just a company that makes GPUs and drives, end up being more valuable than Microsoft, Apple, and Google in the long term? Nvidia has a fantastic business model and ridiculous profit margins, but it still seems unrealistic to me for it's share price to keep growing and growing to a record high market cap at this point.\n\nMy gut feels like there is far too much hype surrounding Nvidia's prospects and price should drop a fair bit. I think it's too risky to buy in now and that after the stock split we will start seeing a correction. Thoughts?\n\nedit: Lol what's with the downvotes? Are we not allowed to have open discussions?",
