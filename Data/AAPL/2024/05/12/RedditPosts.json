        "content": "Hello all, we are both 30 and are receiving an inherited IRA worth about $56,000 after taxes. We are getting rid of the credit card that is making life a little unmanageable at the moment leaving us with about $40,000 to invest. My plan is to leave it alone and add to it $200/mo. One of my kids will graduate in 11 years, and the other in 16 years. Edward Jones (where the IRA is now) wants to have a meeting with me but I think I'm going to cancel that and liquidate to invest myself.  \nI'm planning on throwing $20,000 into ETFs-7500 VOO, 5000 SOXX, 2000 SCHD, 1500 QTUM, 1500 PAVE, 1500 COWZ, 1000 HFXI-$10,000 in long-hold stocks like Microsoft, Google, Apple, Meta, etc. and $10,000 in CDs. Would sincerely like to know your thoughts.",
