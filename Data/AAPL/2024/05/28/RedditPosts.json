        "content": "Exxon Mobil was America’s most valuable publicly traded company for much of the 2000s & early 2010s, as the oil booms during those periods delivered enormous profits. Since the mid-2010s, Apple (and eventually the rest of Big Tech) began to exceed Big Oil’s profits. For much of the past decade, Apple has been the most profitable and most valuable U.S. company, occasionally trading places with Microsoft, the 2nd most profitable U.S. company.\n\nWhich brings us to the current situation. Microsoft is worth $3.2 trillion; Apple is worth $2.9. Microsoft is actually making slightly less profit than Apple but has a shown a higher earnings growth trajectory in recent quarters/years. NVIDIA is worth $2.8 and making about a tenth of MS & Apple’s profits, but might double or triple its earnings this year. One of 3 things can happen:\n\n1) NVIDIA takes #1 and grows into its valuation\n\n2) NVIDIA takes #1 then loses it because it fails to grow into its valuation\n\n3) Wall Street pumps Apple & MS stock higher so this never becomes an issue\n\nIt should be noted the last time the most valuable company did NOT make the most profits, that was Cisco in the early 2000s … and it didn’t end well.",
