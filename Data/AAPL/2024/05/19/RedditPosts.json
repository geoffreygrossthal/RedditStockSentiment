        "content": "I've always heard about compounding investing and while I can understand it with say a high interest savings account where say you put $100 in and you get 10% interest in one year and then reinvest that at $110 at another 10% it grows to $121 (compared to just $100 and getting 20% over two years).  \n\n\nBut if say I buy $100 of apple stock and it grows 20% in two years and it's valued at $120.  How is that compound investing?  It's not like I'm buying apple stock getting $110 at the end of the year and reinvesting it in apple again and then getting $121 and repeating.  No usually you just buy and you buy that ends up being $120.  So I'm just confused on how the whole compounding works for stocks (let's also say there's no dividends to reinvest either)",
