        "content": "Apple announced new versions of its iPad Air and iPad Pro tablet computers on Tuesday in a short video posted on its website.  \n\nApple said that it would come in two sizes: An 11-inch size, that matches older models, and a larger 13-inch model. Both are equipped with Apple’s M2 chip. The smaller iPad costs $599 for 128GB of storage, and the larger iPad starts at $799.\n\nApple has also moved the front-facing camera to the longer side of the device — landscape mode — to be better for videoconferencing, matching Apple’s more-expensive iPad Pro models.\n\nThese are the first new iPad models Apple has released since Oct. 2022, the longest time that Apple has gone without updating the product line since its launch in 2011. The iPad Air, Apple’s mid-tier model, was last updated in March 2022, and comes in a variety of colors, including blue, purple, and a gold color.\n\nIt will be available in stores next week.\n\n“This is the biggest day for iPad since its introduction,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/07/apple-ipad-pro-and-ipad-air-2024-announced.html",
