        "content": "My morning alarm clock banged on my head on 06h33, after a few punches on it, i get up from the bed at 07h00. Picked up the phone and look at the charts. Nice, a very clear trend on the screen. Going to wait for the right moment to go in the trend. After few minutes after a nice pull back i'm in the trade. SL placed according my strategy rules. I was free from the screen!!!\nTaked a bath, clothes on and a nice breakfast. I m relaxed, confident and happy because i did my trade accordly with my strategy. I was glad thinking what about another things that i like and want to do in this day. If the trade go's through along the day or take my daily TP, nice.\nIf the trade dies after a few minutes or so, nice. Tomorrow is another day.\nThis is boring? Maybe. But is a journey, a little bit more or less every day... Much better than my early days of overtrading, addition, anxiety, FOMO and ridiculous hope that tomorrow i would recovery the massive losses...\nTo the follow that feel like that, my message is forget the hope, be strong with yourself, stablish you rules and limits, and steak to them no matter what. In the end the process of trading must to be boring, and you just keep doing it only because you get good money!",
