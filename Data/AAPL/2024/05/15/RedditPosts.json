        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc. is looking to woo its unusually large base of retail investors to get approval for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s $56 billion pay package.\n\nTo help lead that drive, the company's board has hired a strategic adviser, according to a person familiar with the matter. To bolster the campaign, the adviser is working with an outside law firm, the person said.\n\nThe adviser has set up a dedicated Vote Tesla website to encourage participation among retail investors, who hold an estimated 42% of shares in the company. It urges shareholders to cast votes online, by QR code, by phone and by mail. It also features a video with board Chair Robyn Denholm, who says supporting Musk’s pay is critical to Tesla’s growth.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-board-rallies-retail-investors-102216177.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-board-rallies-retail-investors-102216177.html)\n\n",
