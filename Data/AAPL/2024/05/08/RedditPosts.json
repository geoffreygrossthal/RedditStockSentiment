        "content": "Now I’m not saying to sell all of your Apple stock immediately. However, given that:\n\n1. The Vision Pro was a dud, they’re pulling back manufacturing/production\n\n2. iPhone sales are down almost 10%\n\n3. Services didn’t grow as much as we thought they would\n\n4. Apple doing a buyback instead of investing more in R&D (it seems like they’re doing a lot of buybacks lately..)\n\n5. Slow growth in critical markets like China\n\n6. No major product line releases in the future. The Vision Pro was a dud and was too expensive - they thought about doing a car but cancelled that. What’s the next new thing? \n\nDo I think Apple is doomed? Absolutely not. I love their products, especially the m series MacBooks.\n\nBut these points above are a little troubling. TBH I think Microsoft has a brighter future than AAPL. They hold a bigger grip/monopoly on commercial software. \n\nI’m just worried aapl won’t really be a growth stock anymore.",
