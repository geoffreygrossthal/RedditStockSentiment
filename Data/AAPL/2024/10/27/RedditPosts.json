        "content": "Mid 30s here. Advisor yearly fees are around 1.6%. They're strictly just overseeing this account and nothing else, taking out their quarterly fees.\n\nStarted with around 250k in 2022. Account is held in Schwab, value is about now $276k. (Dividends have been taken out quarterly (total taken out around $25k since 2022, will stop these and just re invest them).\n\nThe advisor has invested the majority of my portfolio into multiple equities (NVDA, AVGO, SMCI, QCOM, COHR, IRM, PANW, AAPL, GOOGL, CAT, ZS, etc...) Only 1% of my holdings is in USBSX.\n\nWould I be better off just putting everything in a 3 fund type of portfolio and meeting with a fee based advisor a few times a year?",

        "content": "I just hit 100k in my portfolio with 52% in SP500 (all VOO) and now interested in switching to go heavier in dividend stocks. My portfolios other holdings are “safe” TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL…The two dividend stocks I’m holding are monthly paid dividend all reinvested, (SCM, GLAD) earning me $20 and change a month each and have not lost capital. For some reason my mind is telling me to open a new brokerage account dedicated to only dividend and let my 100k sit dormant, is there any upside to this or is the same as putting money in my current account just reallocate the automatic funds from going to VOO into the dividend stocks. Still kind of hesitant to stop investing in the SP all together. I have a ROTH that is maxed out every year and contribute 6% to my 401k with a 4% company match. No real-estate owned, sheets expensive out there.",

I would appreciate name or links?",
