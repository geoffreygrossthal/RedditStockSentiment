        "content": "So in a few accounts I have accumulated 100k+ over the years with the usual advise of S&P 500 index funds - set it and forget. But every few months I get the urge to sell a part of it and gamble in individual stocks. I did that with Tesla in 2018 (yes it was kind of a gamble then) and that paid off, a few others paid off too but then some didn’t pay off. Overall, am I beating the market? - I am not sure with rollovers from one job to the next that don’t keep track of previous account gains. But I am not loosing either with the strategy. How do you keep this urge/itch away? Just keeping it in S&P 500 is so boring. \n\nEDIT: based on comments I want to add that I do gamble in casinos table games but not more than $500-$1000 a year. It’s fun but I have the thinking that I will loose that 100%. The high from stocks which is 1k-10k gain in a short time is at another level. I don’t bet on penny stocks. These are mostly blue chip like when APPLE or AMAZON or CHIPOTLE does down, I would buy it and then sell in 1-6 months or just sit on it until it goes up. Sometimes stocks like NEO never go up. I also only SELL options. ",
