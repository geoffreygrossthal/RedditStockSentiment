If I see price test but not break below one or two of those, I will typically enter when I see a buy or bullish signal. This is one of my favorite strategies to use simply because it’s simple. \n\nWas simply the move today, and it worked out like I needed it to. Who here thinks $SPY hits $580 this week? Lot of factors to consider, CPI, Minutes, etc… I think if we break ATH we have a real chance to explode. We shall see. \n\nHope you guys killed it today! Let’s keep it rolling. ",
