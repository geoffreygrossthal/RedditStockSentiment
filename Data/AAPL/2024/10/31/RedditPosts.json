        "content": "Intel shares jumped 12% in extended trading on Thursday after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected revenue and issued quarterly guidance that topped expectations.\n\nHere’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus:\n\n* **Earnings per share:** Loss of 46 cents adjusted\n* **Revenue:** $13.28 billion vs. $13.02 billion expected\n\nIntel’s revenue declined 6% year over year in the quarter, which ended on Sept. 28, according to a statement. The company registered a net loss of $16.99 billion, or $3.88 per share, compared with net earnings of $310 million, or 7 cents per share, in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nAs part of its cost reduction plan, Intel recognized $2.8 billion in restructuring charges during the quarter. There were also $15.9 billion in impairment charges.\n\nIntel has been mired in an extended slump due to market share losses in its core businesses and an inability to crack artificial intelligence. CEO Pat Gelsinger revealed plans during the quarter to turn the company’s foundry business into an independent subsidiary, a move that would enable outside funding options.\n\nCNBC reported that Intel had engaged advisors to defend itself against activist investors. In late September, news surfaced that Qualcomm reached out to Intel about a possible takeover.\n\nThe Client Computing Group that sells PC chips recorded $7.33 billion in revenue, down about 7% from a year earlier and below the $7.39 billion consensus among analysts surveyed by StreetAccount.\n\nRevenue from the Data Center and AI segment came to $3.35 billion, which was up about 9% and more than the $3.17 billion consensus from StreetAccount.\n\nIntel called for fiscal third-quarter adjusted earnings of 12 cents per share and revenue between $13.3 billion and $14.3 billion. Analysts had expected 8 cents in adjusted earnings per share and $13.66 billion in revenue.\n\nDuring the quarter, Intel announced the launch of Xeon 6 server processors and Gaudi artificial intelligence accelerators.\n\nAs of Thursday’s close, Intel shares were down about 57% in 2024, while the S&P 500 index had gained 20%.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/31/intel-intc-q3-earnings-report-2024.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/31/intel-intc-q3-earnings-report-2024.html)",

        "content": "**I had recommended Alphabet (GOOG)** [**as a great long-term buy at $150**](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1anr3id/alphabet_goog_150_looks_like_an_excellent_long/), several months ago.\n\nLast evening, Google knocked it out of the park with really stellar results. I bought more shares this morning, and am reiterating a Buy.\n\nI believe analysts’ consensus earnings could be a little conservative and Google should continue to beat estimates with better growth and operating margins.\n\nGoogle's earnings quality is better than several tech giants for the following reasons.\n\n* It has a near monopoly in Search\n* Market leadership in media with YouTube.\n* A strong first-mover advantage with Waymo.\n* A fast-growing Google Cloud business, third only to and catching up with Azure and AWS.\n\n**Its earnings and growth are sustainable, thus it deserves a better valuation and multiple.**\n\nLet's take a closer look at Q3 earnings.\n\nQ3 GAAP EPS came in at $2.12 per share, beating expectations of $1.85 per share $0.27, or 14% - **This was a substantial beat.**\n\nRevenue of $88.3Bn (+14.9% Y/Y) beat by $2.05B or 3%.\n\nConsolidated Alphabet revenues in Q3 2024 increased 15%, or 16% in constant currency, YoY to $88.3Bn reflecting strong momentum across the business.\n\nGoogle Services revenues increased 13% to $76.5 billion, led by strength across Google Search & other, Google subscriptions, platforms, and YouTube ads.\n\n**Total operating income increased 34% and operating margin percent jumped a huge 4.5% to 32%.**\n\nGoogle Cloud revenues grew a whopping 35% to $11.4Bn led by accelerated growth in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) across AI Infrastructure, Generative AI Solutions, and core GCP products, **with record operating margins of 17%** as the cost per AI query decreased by 90% over the past 18 months.\n\nCloud titans Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft (Azure) have commanded huge valuations for their cloud computing businesses; with Google Cloud growing at 35%, it should continue to narrow the gap over the next 5 years. Also importantly, AWS and Azure have operating margins over 30%, and should Google continue to scale and leverage their existing fixed costs, they can reach the same margins. I also believe as they get better at AI, they should be able to charge more.\n\nBased on consensus analysts’ estimates Alphabet’s EPS should grow to $11.60 in 2027 from $5.80 in 2023 - that’s an annual growth rate of 18%. Comparatively, Apple‘s estimated EPS growth through FY2027 is slower at 14%, and it sports a P/E of 33 compared to Google’s 22. Alphabet’s P/E is closer to the S&P 500’s P/E of 21!\n\nI believe this is too low, and there is a lot of potential for its stock to appreciate on the lower valuation.\n\nBesides the strong EPS, a lot of Google’s expenses are noncash depreciation and amortization and their cash flow margins are strong. They generated operating cash of $31Bn on $88Bn last quarter, or a 35% cash flow margin.\n\nThe antitrust regulation will remain a possible negative on Alphabet, but the final decision is still years away as Alphabet vigorously appeals the decision.\n\n**I recommend Alphabet as a buy at $176**",

        "content": "**1.0 Introduction**\n\nBack in 2017, two MIT students (Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi) secured funding from seed accelerator Y Combinator, for what would become Dropbox, one of the first companies to offer **cloud storage and file syncing**.\n\nIt had a first-mover advantage, that combined with a simple user-friendly interface, and a freemium model, allowed the company to grow from **1 million** registered users back in April 2009, to over **700 million** in 2021. Although this sounds impressive, I’ll argue this is *a pointless metric*, but I’ll get back to that.\n\nThe freemium model attracted many users to test out their product and access a limited amount of storage for free. If they need more storage, then they can opt for various paid plans (Dropbox Plus, Dropbox Business).\n\n\n\n**2.0 An incredibly sticky product**\n\nA crucial property to take into account is the **stickiness** of the product**.**\n\n***The perceived risk and effort involved in transferring large volumes of data often outweigh the potential savings of switching services.***\n\nCloud storage platforms hold critical, often irreplaceable, data that users depend on for continuity and productivity. The migration process can seem risky—not just for the potential of data loss or corruption, but also for the disruption it could cause to established workflows and collaborative setups.\n\nMoreover, the time cost of planning, executing, and verifying a migration is significant for larger organizations.\n\n***Even if a competitor offers a cheaper option, the combined weight of time, complexity, and the fear of potential issues can make the cost savings feel secondary.***\n\nFor many users, the existing service might offer just enough value or reliability to make the switch feel unnecessary, reinforcing Dropbox's and similar platforms' stickiness.\n\n\n\n**3.0 The pointless metric & what actually matters.**\n\nIt is not unusual for companies to have some sort of storytelling element in their disclosures, press releases, or earnings reports. The purpose of these elements is nothing else but to create excitement, even if it is pointless.\n\nYou’ll notice, Dropbox chose **registered**, instead of **active**. Given that their base model is free, once someone becomes a user, that person remains a user **forever!** So the number of registered users will always go up.\n\nHowever, if we take a look at the paid subscribers, historically, that is **\\~2.5%** of the registered users. **So, 97.5% of all registered users are freeloaders** ***(including myself)*** **and add no value to the company.**\n\nDon’t get me wrong, having over 18 million paid subscribers is impressive. It is important to focus on this number and acknowledge that the growth days are behind.\n\nThe competition is fierce, ranging from Google and Amazon to Microsoft and Apple. What surprised me was that during the pandemic, there was ***no growth acceleration.***\n\n\n\n**4.0 The past acquisitions**\n\nThe company has engaged in numerous acquisitions:\n\n* **July 2012, TapEngage** \\- *a startup that enables advertisers and publishers to collaborate on tablet-optimized advertising.*\n* **December 2012, Audiogalaxy** \\- *a startup allowing users to store their music files and playlists in the cloud and then stream them to any device.*\n* **December 2012, Snapjoy** \\- *a company allowing users to \"aggregate, archive and view all of their digital photos from their cameras, phones and popular apps.*\n* **July 2013, Endorse** \\- *a mobile coupon startup.*\n* **April 2014, Loom** \\- *a photo-sharing company which would be shut down and integrated with the then-recently announced Carouse*\n* **April 2014, Hackpad** \\- *a document-sharing startup*\n* **May 2014, Bubbli -** *a startup that has built some innovative ways of incorporating 3D technology into 2D views, and packaging it in a mobile app.*\n* **January 2015, CloudOn** \\- *a company that provided mobile applications for document editing and creation.*\n* **January 2019, HelloSign** \\- *e-signature company* ***(largest acquisition $230m).***\n* **March 2021, DocSend** \\- *secure document sharing and analytics product.*\n* **October 2021, Command E** \\- universal search company\n* **November 2022, Boxcryptor** \\- *end-to-end zero-knowledge encryption for cloud storage services*\n* **December 2022, FormSwift** \\- *form management platform*\n\n\n\nThere have been many studies that acquisitions (on average) tend to destroy shareholders’ value. If you agree with that, then Dropbox should be avoided like the plague given their past activity.\n\n\n\n**5.0 The financials**\n\nIf you look at the financials, this is impressive, especially given the fact that they’re competing with Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple.\n\nThe revenue grew from $845m back in 2016 to $2.5 billion in the last twelve months.\n\nThe operating margin improved from **-23%** (-$194m) to **+26%** ($670m).\n\nA lot of focus (especially from the management) goes to FCF and there’s a reason for that. Every company that has high stock-based compensation would like to focus on the free cash flow, as SBC is a non-cash expense.\n\nFrom 2018 (when the company became public) until H1-2024, the company generated **$3.9 billion** in free cash flow. This might sound impressive, given its market cap is $8.5 billion, however, it incurred **$2.3 billion** in stock-based compensation.\n\nSo, where did the $3.9 billion go to? **Share buybacks.** The number of shares outstanding is down \\~20% since becoming a public company.\n\nBased on their capital allocation over the last 5 years, it seems as if their capital allocation strategy has changed from **acquiring more companies** to **returning capital to the shareholders via buybacks**.\n\n  \n**6.0 The valuation**\n\nHow does one value a company of this kind?\n\nIt has a sticky product that generates relatively stable cash flow that is returned to the shareholders via buybacks. I’ll argue that it has a lot of similarities with a bond and a **dividend discount model** is an appropriate model to value a company of this kind.\n\nExcept, instead of using the dividend, I’ll use **free cash flow** **- SBC.**\n\nInputs:\n\nFree cash flow - SBC of $450m.\n\nGrowth in perpetuity of 4%.\n\nDiscount rate of 8%.\n\nAdjusting for cash/debt\n\nThe value of the company is $8.8 billion ($27/share), which isn't that far off from today's share price of $26/share.\n\n  \n**7.0 My thoughts**\n\nA company with a sticky product that has stable financial performance is expected to be less volatile than the average company out there. This is indeed the case, and the stock price beta is 0.6. Beta is a measure of risk that compares the volatility of the share price vs. an index (in this case, the S&P500). However, low risk goes hand in hand with low return. Therefore, expecting \\~8% long-term yield seems fair.\n\nI don’t find this an attractive opportunity, at this price point. However, *if the share price decreases to $20*, then the answer would be different.\n\nThe only scenario where I see a significant upside is if Dropbox is being acquired by a giant, such as Salesforce.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this post, feel free to share your thoughts.",

Despite Tesla being clearly very far behind actual FSD, Waymo is doing AV, and doing it good. They are partenered with UBER and the AV fleet actually had the highest rated score on the platform (as mentioned by their CEO in the earnings call). Beside Waymo, they are partenered with 14 AV companies, including Aurora which they also have a big stake in. AV is coming, maybe not now, maybe not next year, but it is inevitably coming. And all these AV, especially the smaller ones, need a platform to operate their fleet. Do you build it from the ground up or join UBER who has 25 million rides a day already?\n\nThey are also partnered with BYD for the electrification of their fleet. Guess what is BYD also working on? Yeah, thats right, AVs. And judging BYD/China success on doing EVs, I think thats a pretty good chance they will also succeed on the AV side. And since they are already partenered, where do you think BYDs AV fleet will be used? In UBER.\n\nI think the company is positioned greatly for the future, its profitable after multiple years of negative EPS, it has a clear plan moving forward about their free cash flow, including reducing $2B out of their debt by the end of the year. \n\nDisclaimer, I do have a position in UBER.",

They have been bleeding cash (see below) and they probably no longer have $1.5 billion in their bank accounts anymore.\n\n[https:\\/\\/s204.q4cdn.com\\/707617056\\/files\\/doc\\_financials\\/2024\\/q4\\/Earnings-Deck-Q4FY24-V5-w-2-of-2-at-end.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/m0e0wpire4yd1.png?width=2514&format=png&auto=webp&s=47a2e8faaf9f971a162bbe0e1e716960c738f983)\n\nSupermicro Announces Pricing of Private Offering of $1.5 Billion of Convertible Senior Notes Due 2029\n\nFebruary 23, 2024\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ: SMCI) (“Supermicro” or the “Company”), a Total IT Solution Manufacturer for AI, Cloud, Storage, and 5G/Edge, today announced the pricing of $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due 2029 (the “Convertible Notes”). The Convertible Notes are being offered and sold to “qualified institutional buyers” pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Company also granted a 13-day option to the initial purchasers to purchase up to an additional $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes.\n\nThe Convertible Notes will be senior, unsecured obligations of the Company. The Convertible Notes will not bear regular interest, and the principal amount of the Convertible Notes will not accrete. **The Convertible Notes have an initial conversion rate of 0.7455 shares of the Company's common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $1,341.38 per share of the Company’s common stock, representing an initial conversion premium of approximately 37.5% above the closing price of $975.52 per share of the Company’s common stock on February 22, 2024)**. The conversion rate and conversion price will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events.\n\nThe Convertible Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part (subject to certain limitations), for cash at the Company’s option at any time, and from time to time, on or after March 1, 2027 and on or before the 20th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for a specified period of time. The redemption price will be equal to the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.\n\n**Holders of the Convertible Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes) at a cash repurchase price of 100% of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid special and additional interest**, if any, to, but excluding the applicable repurchase date. The Convertible Notes will mature on March 1, 2029, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2028, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and during certain periods, and on and after September 1, 2028, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, the Convertible Notes will be convertible regardless of these conditions. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock at the Company’s election. The Company expects to close the offering on February 27, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of various customary closing conditions.\n\n[https://ir.supermicro.com/news/news-details/2024/Supermicro-Announces-Pricing-of-Private-Offering-of-1.5-Billion-of-Convertible-Senior-Notes-Due-2029/default.aspx](https://ir.supermicro.com/news/news-details/2024/Supermicro-Announces-Pricing-of-Private-Offering-of-1.5-Billion-of-Convertible-Senior-Notes-Due-2029/default.aspx)\n\n[As of last quarter, SMCI had $1.67B in cash and were cash flow negative in 3 consecutive quarters!](https://preview.redd.it/nm512jp3d4yd1.png?width=2324&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a43e6580775499be8ddb527fa6a8398e856f44e)",

They already have 2 smartphone OEMs lined up for 2025, and they just finished their fab2 in Malaysia. They have a patent to protect their proprietary process behind their silicon batteries. They are the first to use 100% active silicon batteries in the consumer market. Competitors cannot just spin up a fab easily.\n\nThey are positioned to ramp up production in 2025 with profits coming in early 2026.\n\nThey recently raised $100m via stockholder dilution, out of their 168m total outstanding shares. This is roughly only 6% dilution. As of today, their share price has dropped 19%. The $100m dilution along with $200m cash on hand, allows them to survive for 6 more quarters at a minimum, assuming they still continue to burn $50m in cash per quarter, without *any* efficiency gains. That positions that well for the beginning of 2026 play. More partnerships, more customers, lower CAPEX, different segments of customers, will all drive the price up. \n\nNext-gen batteries and EVs and component manufacturers are a long-term play\n\nI believe ENVX is currently underpriced. As of current price $8.45, my EOY price target is $12, and by end of next year, I see $18 at a minimum.",

        "content": "Hi - I made an in-kind transfer equities transfer from Etrade to Robinhood in 2022. (Please don't roast me for the choice of Robinhood - long story but it was the right decision at the time for certain reasons, e.g. access to margin at a really low rate, interest on sweep etc.)\n\nEquities were purchased between 2018 and 2021, then transferred in 2022. \n\nI now sold some of the equities made in that in-kind transfer - and Robinhood sent me a 1099 form with those equities as uncovered lots with a $0 cost basis.\n\nI spent several weeks back and forth between Etrade and Robinhood, trying to ensure that the cost basis transfer was made. It took a lot, but in the end I got confirmation from Robinhood that they have received the cost basis from Etrade.\n\nThe cost basis was sent/received in August of this year.\n\nHowever, all Robinhood say they are able to provide me in terms of a proper cost basis (after receiving it from Etrade) is an Excel CSV export (assume what they received from Etrade). They say I must now take this export to a tax professional to submit my own cost basis along with my uncovered securities 1099.\n\nI know the easy answer is \"this is the treatment you get with a joke of a broker like Robinhood\" - which may very well be the case.\n\nBut my understanding is that the receiving brokerage of an in-kind transfer is legally obligated to receive and update the cost basis from the sending brokerage. This is not really a discretionary element.\n\nRobinhood refuse to send me an updated 1099, and say its an industry standard that individuals have to self-report the cost basis on uncovered lots. However, these are only \"uncovered lots\" because Robinhood is not fulfilling their obligation of updating the cost basis they have confirmed that they have received.\n\nSpecific questions:  \n\\- Does anyone know if I can go after them from a legal obligation standpoint on this? I have tried everything in terms of tantrums and explanations over email/phone  \n\\- In what format could I demand an updated cost basis from Robinhood? Is it an updated 1099 or some other document?  \n\\- Will I have the same problem as I continue to sell off equities from this in-kind transfer for future tax years? Where Robinhood will never include the cost basis and have them as uncovered lots in my 1099s?\n\nThanks so much for your help and self-restraing in crucifying me for choosing Robinhood.",

        "content": "So, my first test of Apple Intelligence on MacBook was with Pages. I used the privacy statement about apple intelligence, and formatted it for conciseness. It came back with:\n\n    Apple Intelligence, a generative AI system, aids with daily tasks. It helps rewrite emails, proofread notes, summarize missed messages, create memories in Photos, and generate images. Apple Intelligence delivers personalized intelligence without collecting personal data.\n    \n    To provide a customized experience, Apple Intelligence uses device information, including calendar events and frequently used apps, to identify the necessary data for generative models. Apple Intelligence runs models on-device to complete tasks without data leaving the device, like email summaries. However, for complex tasks, Apple Intelligence sends requests to Private Cloud Compute, a server-based intelligence system that handles more demanding requests while protecting privacy.\n    \n    When you initiate an Apple Intelligence task, your device analyzes if it can complete it locally. If not, Apple Intelligence uses Private Cloud Compute to send only relevant data to Apple silicon servers for processing. The data is not stored or accessible to Apple and is processed only to fulfill your request, after which it’s securely returned to your device. Apple collects limited information about requests, such as size, features used, and completion time, but not content or returned results. This data doesn’t identify you or link to your Apple Account or other data from other Apple services.\n    \n    To see how your data is processed, go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Intelligence Report, turn on Record Apple Intelligence Activity, and export a file after requests.\n\nBut it was even more cool to see the \"friendly\" re-write:\n\n    Apple Intelligence is a suite of AI models that make your daily tasks a breeze. It can help you rewrite or proofread your emails and notes, summarize your missed messages, create custom memories in Photos, generate images, and more. The best part? Apple Intelligence doesn’t collect your personal data to provide personalized intelligence.\n    \n    To give you a tailored experience, Apple Intelligence uses info on your device, like your upcoming calendar events and frequently used apps. It figures out what data it needs from your device to help you out without storing that data on Apple’s servers.\n    \n    When possible, Apple Intelligence models run entirely on your device, so you can complete tasks without your data leaving your device. For instance, when Apple Intelligence gives you preview summaries of your emails, messages, and notifications, these summaries are generated by on-device models. But there are times when Apple Intelligence needs a model that requires more power than your device can provide. In those cases, Apple Intelligence sends your request to Private Cloud Compute. Private Cloud Compute is a server-based intelligence system that can handle more complex requests while keeping your privacy safe. For example, when you use Writing Tools to proofread or edit an email, your device might send the email to Private Cloud Compute for a server-based model to do the proofreading or editing.\n    \n    When you start an Apple Intelligence task, your device’s built-in model checks if it can handle the task on your device. If not, Apple Intelligence uses Private Cloud Compute to send only the data needed for your request to Apple silicon servers. The data stays on Apple’s servers and isn’t shared with anyone else. It’s only used to process your request, and then it’s sent back to your device securely. Apple doesn’t keep it or use it for anything else. When your device sends a request to Private Cloud Compute, Apple only collects some basic info about the request, like how big it is and how long it takes. This info doesn’t include any details about what you asked for or what the answer was. It’s not linked to your Apple Account or any other data Apple might have from your other Apple services.\n    \n    You can turn on transparency logging for Apple Intelligence on your device to see how your data is processed. Just go to Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Intelligence Report and turn on Record Apple Intelligence Activity. After you make a request, you can also save a copy of the data that was processed.\n\nThis certainly is an introspective moment! Like asking Siri about Siri when Siri was new.",
