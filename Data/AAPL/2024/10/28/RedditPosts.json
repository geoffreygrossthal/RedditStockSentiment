        "content": "JPMorgan Chase has begun suing customers who allegedly stole thousands of dollars from ATMs by taking advantage of a technical glitch that allowed them to withdraw funds before a check bounced.\n\nThe bank on Monday filed lawsuits in at least three federal courts, taking aim at some of the people who withdrew the highest amounts in the so-called infinite money glitch that went viral on TikTok and other social media platforms in late August.\n\nA Houston case involves a man who owes JPMorgan $290,939.47 after an unidentified accomplice deposited a counterfeit $335,000 check at an ATM, according to the bank.\n\n‚ÄúOn August 29, 2024, a masked man deposited a check in Defendant‚Äôs Chase bank account in the amount of $335,000,‚Äù the bank said in the Texas filing. ‚ÄúAfter the check was deposited, Defendant began withdrawing the vast majority of the ill-gotten funds.‚Äù\n\nJPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is investigating thousands of possible cases related to the ‚Äúinfinite money glitch,‚Äù though it hasn‚Äôt disclosed the scope of associated losses. Despite the waning use of paper checks as digital forms of payment gain popularity, they‚Äôre still a major avenue for fraud, resulting in $26.6 billion in losses globally last year, according to Nasdaq‚Äôs Global Financial Crime Report.\n\nThe infinite money glitch episode highlights the risk that social media can amplify vulnerabilities discovered at a financial institution. Videos began circulating in late August showing people celebrating the withdrawal of wads of cash from Chase ATMs shortly after bad checks were deposited.\n\nNormally, banks only make available a fraction of the value of a check until it clears, which takes several days. JPMorgan says it closed the loophole a few days after it was discovered.\n\nMiami and California\n\nThe other lawsuits filed Monday are in courts including Miami and the Central District of California, and involve cases where JPMorgan says customers owe the bank sums ranging from about $80,000 to $141,000.\n\nMost cases being examined by the bank are for far smaller amounts, according to people with knowledge of the situation who declined to be identified speaking about the internal investigation.\n\nIn each case, JPMorgan says its security team reached out to the alleged fraudster, but it hasn‚Äôt been repaid for the phony checks, in violation of the deposit agreement that customers sign when creating an account with the bank.\n\nJPMorgan is seeking the return of the stolen funds with interest and overdraft fees, as well as lawyers‚Äô fees and, in some cases, punitive damages, according to the complaints.\n\nCriminal cases?\n\nThe lawsuits are likely to be just the start of a wave of litigation meant to force customers to repay their debts and signal broadly that the bank won‚Äôt tolerate fraud, according to the people familiar. JPMorgan prioritized cases with large dollar amounts and indications of possible ties to organized crime, they said.\n\nThe civil cases are separate from potential criminal investigations; JPMorgan says it has also referred cases to law enforcement officials across the country.\n\n‚ÄúFraud is a crime that impacts everyone and undermines trust in the banking system,‚Äù JPMorgan spokesman Drew Pusateri said in a statement to CNBC. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pursuing these cases and actively cooperating with law enforcement to make sure if someone is committing fraud against Chase and its customers, they‚Äôre held accountable.‚Äù\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/28/jpmorgan-suing-customers-over-infinite-money-glitch.html",

        "content": "The big four tech giants are expected to spend a record $56 billion in total capital expenditures in the third quarter, according to the average estimate of analysts aggregated by Bloomberg. Much of that spending will go to NVIDIA and other AI-related device makers, with further increases expected in the coming quarters.\nAll signs point to continued strong AI-related spending. From chip device maker Asmax (ASML.US) to TSMC (TSM.US), AI has been a big part of this earnings season.\nThat backdrop has pushed NVIDIA shares higher, while Chief Executive Jen-Hsun Huang has assured that production of its new Blackwell chips is going well and demand is strong. NVIDIA is the biggest beneficiary of the big investment in artificial intelligence computing devices. The stock hit an all-time high last week and now has a market capitalization of about $3.5 trillion, slightly less than Apple (AAPL.US), which is still the world's most valuable company.\nTo be sure, there are concerns about the big tech companies' spending on artificial intelligence, as investors believe the billions of dollars these companies are investing are generating relatively little revenue. As such, this will be another focus of attention this week when these companies report earnings.\nYou have to walk the fine line of investing,‚Äú said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer at Themes ETFs, ‚Äòso that investors understand that you're ‚Äônot going too far‚Äù.\nNvidia's revenue is expected to more than double this year to $125.6 billion, according to the average forecast of analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Next year, the chipmaker's fiscal year 2026, sales are expected to grow 44 percent to $181 billion.\nOf course, there are other companies benefiting from high AI spending, including Broadcom, Ultra Micro Computer and Dell Technologies.",

Let me lube you guys up with a small play this monday to get in the mood.\n\nToday I got 2 earnings plays for y'all: **Crocs** and **PayPal**, both reporting tomorrow before the open. I also have 2 bonus lotto plays on 2 no-name trash companies that report today after the bell; they‚Äôll be in the TLDR at the bottom.\n\n1. **CROX** \\- In my last post, I opened a long position on DECK since I noticed a big trend with Uggs all over social media, and it paid off. Now I'm seeing the same thing with Crocs. People don‚Äôt care that they look like shit anymore; they think it's fashion now. You know those charms you put in the holes of Crocs? Every kid wants them these days. They don‚Äôt realize you can get the exact same charms from China for 5% of the price. That‚Äôs what I did, and I‚Äôve been rocking the same Crocs for 6 years now. Those crocodiles know how to make shoes man...... Also McDonalds put mini Crocs toys in their happy meals. Expect green dildos.\n2. **PYPL -** PayPal is notorious for having big expectations but then underdelivering. Mfs are trading at a 52W high right now, really poised for a big correction. Apple pay, Google pay, Adyen, Stripe, Square‚Äîthey're all getting a slice of the cake now. Intel nana is praying for PayPal's downfall. Do not be surprised if this stock goes tits up.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hu87v4wtghxd1.jpg?width=4271&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb91dc692518920b8eb71299312b68113b2e6be8\n\n**tldr:  PYPL go down, CROX go up**\n\n**bonus plays:** I'm shorting both **CDNS** (Cadence Design Systems), and **AMKR** (Amkor Technology).

        "content": "Google is set to announce its Q3 earnings on October 29th, after U.S. markets close. Here are key focal points:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cr5hbq1wfixd1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=0ff6f4e0fed7df1b00513c9079e04ecc89b8b18f\n\n**Advertising:**\n\nGoogle remains the world's undisputed leader in search. Data shows that as of September 30th, Google's web traffic rose 1% from the previous quarter, reaching 2.7 billion visits, while Bing, its closest competitor, saw a 3% drop to just 58 million visits. Google's daily active users (DAU) for Q3 grew about 1% quarter-over-quarter and 6% year-over-year.\n\nHowever, even Google must remain vigilant. Google's search dominance is being challenged as fast-rising competitors like TikTok and Amazon capture market share. In fact, Google's share of the U.S. search ad market is expected to dip below 50% next year‚Äîa first in over a decade.\n\n**Google Cloud:**\n\nIn the second quarter, Alphabet's results revenue from Google Cloud surged 28% YoY.‚ÄÇCan such high growth be sustained? Let's wait and see.\n\n**YouTube:**\n\nYouTube outpaced Instagram and TikTok in DAU growth over the last quarter. In July, August, and September, YouTube maintained positive DAU growth, while its three main competitors saw declines. Additionally, YouTube extended the maximum length of Shorts from 1 minute to 3 minutes, improving monetization potential.\n\n**Other Growth Areas:**\n\nAlphabet has several potential revenue drivers that have yet to impact its bottom line. Waymo, Alphabet's autonomous driving unit, has partnered with Uber to offer driverless rides in Atlanta and Austin. Additionally, Alphabet's Cloud division, which posted $10 billion in revenue and $1 billion in operating profit in Q2, holds strong growth potential.\n\n**Capital Expenditure:**\n\nIn July, CEO Sundar Pichai stated, \"The risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting for us.\" However, Wall Street's patience is limited; investors are looking for returns on AI investments sooner rather than later. Progress in AI commercialization will be a key focus in this earnings report.\n\n**Antitrust Concerns:**\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has launched an antitrust investigation into Google, hinting at a potential breakup. However, history suggests that forced breakups are rare. Google's relatively low valuation already reflects the policy risks it faces.",

Somehow and someway - that no longer occurs.

I was also lurking on r/homelab and it seems that popular choices from second-hand markets are Dell, HP, or Lenovo servers.\n\nFrom my understanding and reading, Mac products seem to be used a lot in media industry, for instance, for rendering.

Do you still use macOS or just install Linux/BSD?\n\nMany thanks!",

I think it is tracked spatial audio, it seems to change as I move my head (though doesn't do a great job tracking!).\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any way to get from full screen playback to the menu bar (where the setting lives) without stopping playback, at which point the spatial audio option disappears. I tried disabling \"Spatial audio follows head movements\" in Accessibility but it didn't help.\n\nOnly a minor annoyance as I only use it for the Nike Training Club app, but was curious if anyone knew of a solution!",

Here's the basic rundown of my strategy:\n\n1. stocks only go up\\*\n\n2. when stocks go up calls go up more\\*\\*\n\n3. hold calls for at least 1 year (LEAPS) to pay less on capital gains tax\n\n  \\* usually\n\n  \\*\\* sometimes\n\nNow that we have the best strategy to maximize our gains we should also take a few steps to minimize our  losses. No matter how many gains you get it's all over if you multiply by 0 a single time. The best way to avoid that is with diversification.\n\nfour-step diversification process:\n\n1. buy calls on etfs instead of stocks so any one company can't bankrupt you\n\n2. buy different etfs WITH LOW CORRELATION. I considered hedging QQQ with SPY but...\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hi0kdnskpjxd1.png?width=492&format=png&auto=webp&s=a8e4283533b12dc738964d3e619aa7ef37593bd1\n\nit wouldn't be much of a hedge at all at .84 correlation. Instead I went with XLP:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/z4xsm39ppjxd1.png?width=254&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f977779a87e372d3f2668c2f393b1274e204e1d\n\n3. buy calls at different expiration dates so you don't get blown up by one freak event (like March 2020)\n\n4. leave some money \"on the sidelines\" (in QQQ shares) so you can still buy the dip if stocks go down or sideways for 2 or more years\n\nWith those rules in mind the two etfs I picked were QQQ and XLP as the LEAPS offerings were pretty limited on Robinhood 6 years ago and these two backtested the best given my strategy.  \n\n\n\"Show all time\"\n\nRobinhood's all time chart sucks and makes it look like I started with 160k in 2018. I actually started with 3k and made steady deposits every few months since then.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7fimq74iqjxd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=866eadc4b89dbfa6040c708247a0db8f83ef600d\n\nIf you wanted to see the real %return of my strategy over the past 6 years you would have to track every buy, sell, deposit, and withdrawal so you could adjust the % gains based on my total cost basis at the time... which I attempted here: [Supplemental Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/lightStoleMyName/comments/1geawok/an_attempt_at_adjusting_total_return_for_deposits/)\n\nIn the end it was more like +350% all time for a 27% average annual return. Compared to QQQ shares in the same timeframe (+160% for 15% annual) it's not half bad. Compare it to TQQQ on the other hand (+390%) and yeah maybe I'm just massively over-complicating the process of getting leverage. As expected QQQ calls outperformed by a lot accounting for 180k of my gains but my underperforming XLP calls (just 78k of gains) are the price I pay for being a wuss.\n\nBelow is the screenshot after selling everything that was up for long term gains cuz I know you're supposed to sell for a gain post. The QQQ calls are staying a litter longer because technically I bought them on Oct 27 but the dividend event makes robinhood mark them as Dec 28th so I wanna be real sure they won't miss-categorize them as short term capital gains before I sell. I reached out to customer support at 10:00AM and they'll \"check with the back office team and email me within the hour\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/mo2x3mq4tjxd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0563852d35c888d7b4a7557a2bc411ab98b99f04\n\nTLDR: everyone is a genius in a bull market and this is just one way of getting leverage, but it's my way and I like it.",

That will pay out about a 3.5% premium.\n\n\nIf the market goes down I out perform the market by at least 3.5%. Then I can use the premium to buy shares at a depressed price.\n\nIf the market goes up less than 13.5% I still outperform the market.\n\nI only lose if the market goes up over 13.5%. Not the best but at least I got a nice return. \n\nWith more volatile investments like QQQ or individual stocks you can higher premiums and higher strike prices.\n\nQQQ - strike price 15% higher than current price. Premium is 4.5%. Basically the only way you lose is if the QQQ goes up more than 20%\n\nDoes this strategy make sense?\n\nI would think the majority of years you would win out. Especially if it‚Äôs something like QQQ. How many years does it go up over 20%? How many years does it go down or go up less than 20%? I‚Äôd say at least 70% of the time you will win.\n\nAnd even if you ‚Äòlose‚Äô you could roll the options one year into the future and you won‚Äôt have to sell your shares\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This means SHigeru Ishiba has to find new allies within 30 days to keep power. **The Bank of Japan‚Äôs rate path may face added complications with a weaker government. So less rate hikes.**\n* Yen down today on this, nikkei higher on this.¬†\n* Oil down as ISrael attack on Iran didnt target any oil facilities but instead focused on military bases. This reduces supply disruption which removes a tailwind for oil. Iran also downplayed the attack saying they do not want war. Traders had been bullish on oil on fri, v strong flow, but now IV crush lower. Traders caught out. nearing next support zone at 65.5-67\n* SPX: Slightly higher, trading above the 5835 key level.¬†\n* Nasdaq: Bounced off of 20,500 level in premarket. Most major big tech names higher.¬†\n* Dow Jones: After sell off over last week, is just trying to recover the breakout at 42,300.¬†\n* HKG50 - flat, despite China‚Äôs announcement of more stimulus. This shows that the stimulus announced did little to wet the appetite of investors.¬†\n* GER40: gapped up but pared all the gains now flat on the day.¬†\n* VIX: maintaining at 19.24.\n* bond yields elevated. I will be hoping to see bond yields cool off as a result of plunging oil prices. Higher bond yields are a headwind to teh amrket as they attract invstor capital away from equities. We want to see bond yields fall asap, which should happen if we look at historical data on rising bond yields following the first rate cut.\n\n**MAG 7:**\n\n* TSLA - Bernstein gives another underperform rating, price target at 120. I think Bernstein can basically be ignored at this point. They are Tesla perma bulls and it‚Äôs just getting boring at this point. Said that margin strength in last quarter was driven by one off deferred revenue recognitions and commodity contract renewals. Said 20-30% unit growth as Tesla suggested is unlikely.\n* TSLA - Price target raised to 298 from 278 at Canaccord, who maintain their buy rating.¬†\n* TSLA - price target raised to 285 from 225 at Daiwa. Maintained at Buy.¬†\n* These are more respectable price targets although I think Canaccord are closer to the mark.¬†\n* TSLA.- extends its 5 year 0% interest loan offer in China until November 30th - increasing incentives on China demand. Applies to rear wheel drive and long range versions.¬†\n* MST ahead of earnings, Truist mark as a buy, says they are set to outperform across key enterprise categories. Price target 600.¬†\n* AAPL - JPM say that in their tracker of Apple product availability (as a proxy of demand), they see that lead times are more or less in line with iPhone 15, hence demand resilient.¬†\n\nOTHER COMPANIES:\n\n* Crypto names all higher in premarket again on strong bitcoin price action.\n* Oil stocks all lower obviously on oil dumping. ¬†\n* CORZ - Jefferies initiated with buy rating, price target of 19. Said journey is impressive post bankruptcy comeback story. Said they are now utilising their power for Ai focused data centres.¬†\n* HOOD - launching contracts that allow users to bet on the 2024 presidential election, following federal court ruling that cleared the way for election betting in the US.¬†\n* INTC - expanding their facility in Chengdu, China in order to boost server chip packaging.¬†\n* GPN - Bernstein says that they are rated at market perform, and represent a potential activist investor play.¬†\n* LLY - received approval to sell Mounjaro in Hong Kong with sales expected to start by year end. This is their weight management and diabetes drug. They got ahead of NVO who haven‚Äôt launched their weight loss drug in Hong Kong yet.¬†\n* Volkswagen is planning to cut costs, considering a 10% wage bill reduction and 2 year wage freeze. Also potential to cap bonuses for top employees\n* TSM has suspended shipments to chinese chipmaker Sophgo after the TSM chips were found on Huawei‚Äôs Ascend. They say that Sophgo illegally redistributed TSM chips.\n* Bigger news, TSM founder says the firm can still see most severe challenges from US restrictions.¬†\n* MCD - ahead of earnings tomorrow, they announce they are bringing back quarter pounders next week after e coli outbreak is contained. Said that the contaminated products are no longer in their supply chain.¬†\n* Boeing is planing a $15B+ capital raise in order to avoid junk credit rating. They will raise this through.

EXPECTATION IS FOR HIGHER BORROWING, TAX HIKES AND HIGHER SPENDING. Likely will see net growth positive budget, so more likely for cautious BoE cuts.¬†\n* Big tech earnings this week - generally, major desks are optimistic going into the week.¬† JPM says the fact that any earnings question marks are being overlooked entirely with NFLX, NOW and VRT, bodes well for Mega cap earnings this week.¬†\n* Apple in my opinion the one most likely to disappoint.¬†\n* China announces a new outright open market reverse repo tool, targeting primary dealers.¬†\n* Note that in truth this is useless. China here want to look like they are doing QE without actually doing QE it seems.
