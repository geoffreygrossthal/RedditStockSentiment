The Company has begun the process of identifying a successor independent registered public accounting firm. The Company will authorize EY to respond fully to the inquiries of the successor independent registered public accounting firm, once selected. The Company does not currently expect that resolution of any of the matters raised by EY, or under consideration by the Special Committee, as noted below, will result in any restatements of its quarterly reports for the fiscal year 2024 ending June 30, 2024, or for prior fiscal years.*\r  \n\r  \n*EY was engaged on March 15, 2023 to perform an audit for the Company’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2024, and has not issued any report on the Company’s financial statements or the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. EY resigned while conducting the audit for the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, EY’s first audit on the Company’s behalf.*\r  \n\r  \n*In late July 2024, EY communicated to the Audit Committee concerns about several matters relating to governance, transparency and completeness of communications to EY, and other matters pertaining to the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, and that the timely filing of the Company’s annual report was at significant risk. In response, the Board appointed an independent special committee of the Board (the “Special Committee”) to review the matters and certain of the Company’s internal controls and certain governance procedures (the “Review”). The Special Committee engaged Cooley LLP, and forensic accounting firm Secretariat Advisors, LLC to perform an investigation on behalf of and at the direction of the Special Committee. EY and the Board received updates with preliminary information relating to the Review. As of the date of this Current Report on Form 8-K, the Review remains ongoing and final findings and recommendations have not yet been communicated to EY or the Board.*\r  \n\r  \n*After receiving additional information through the Review process, EY informed the Special Committee that the additional information EY received raised questions, including about whether the Company demonstrates a commitment to integrity and ethical values consistent with Principle 1 of the COSO Framework, about the ability and willingness of the Audit Committee and overall Board to demonstrate and act as an oversight body that is independent of the CEO and other members of management in accordance with Principle 2 of the COSO Framework, and whether EY could rely on representations from certain members of management and from the Audit Committee. In the Resignation Letter, EY stated, in part: “we are resigning due to information that has recently come to our attention which has led us to no longer be able to rely on management's and the Audit Committee’s representations and to be unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management, and after concluding we can no longer provide the Audit Services in accordance with applicable law or professional obligations.”*\r  \n\r  \n*Although the Company recognizes EY’s decision is final, it disagrees with EY’s decision to resign as the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm – the Special Committee has not yet obtained all information relevant for the Review and has not concluded the Review. Nevertheless, the Company has taken the concerns expressed by EY seriously, and will carefully consider the findings of the Special Committee and any remedial or other actions recommended by the Special Committee following conclusion of the Review.*\r  \n\r  \n*Other than as described above, during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the subsequent interim period preceding EY’s resignation, (1) there were no “disagreements,” as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K, with EY on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, which if not resolved to EY’s satisfaction to our knowledge would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter thereof in connection with its report, and (2) there were no “reportable events” as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.*\r  \n\r  \n*The Company has provided EY with a copy of the disclosures required by Item 304(a) of Regulation S-K contained in Item 4.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K and has requested that EY furnish the Company with a letter addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the Company’s statements made in response to those requirements and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. A copy of EY’s letter, dated October 29, 2024, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.*",

        "content": "Multinational payment card services corporation Visa has been planning to lay off nearly 1,400 employees and contractors by the end of 2024. \n\nAccording to sources familiar with the matter, Visa intends to fire around 1,400 employees and contractors to advance its strategy to simplify its international business. Initially reported by the Wall Street Journal, the announcement stated that approximately 1,000 of the cuts are projected to remove technology positions, with the majority of the layoffs being focused on Visa’s merchant sales and global digital partnership roles.\n\nThe report mentions that a part of the layoffs ensued a week before the news dropped, with Visa encouraging individuals to apply for open positions. However, Visa intends to maintain its workers in the global digital partnership teams employed in their positions through the end of 2024. According to a Visa representative cited by Reuters, the company works towards evolving its operational model to advance its growth, which can in turn lead to the elimination of some roles currently present. Despite this, Visa plans to employ more individuals each year for the foreseeable future, depending on its needs and demands.\n\nVisa’s legal issues\n\nRecently, Visa has been facing legal issues and was under scrutiny from regulators, as well as dissatisfied merchants. For example, in September 2024, The US Justice Department sued Visa for monopolising the debit card market, charging significant fees, and inhibiting competition. The civil antitrust lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, charged the company with violating sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act due to more than 60% of debit transactions in the US running on its debit network.\n\nMoreover, Visa was alleged to unlawfully amassed the capability to extract fees that exceeded what it could charge in a competitive market. At the same time, merchants and banks transferred those funds to consumers by scaling prices or by minimising the quality of services. This led to Visa’s conduct negatively impacting the price of everything. The lawsuit was filed to reinstate competition in the market and to support the US public.\n\nSources:\nhttps://thepaypers.com/payments-general/visa-plans-to-fire-1400-employees-and-contractors--1270771\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/business/visa-plans-to-lay-off-around-1-400-employees-and-contractors-cd278c71?msockid=30e79273349267d731268767356866d0\n\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-29/visa-shares-reverse-earlier-gains-after-report-of-1-400-job-cuts",

        "content": "SMCI has faced allegations of accounting manipulation, which have escalated this morning when it was revealed that their auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. The true extent of the situation is not yet known to the public\n\nSMCI is one of Nvidia's largest customers, accounting for 9% of their sales. If they go under, Nvidia will take a massive hit to their future earnings.\n\nSome may argue that it does not matter, because since Nvidia's production is sold out, any gap in orders would be filled by other customers. There are 2 problems with this assumption:\n\n1. This ignores the impact of a hypothetical liquidation of SMCI. If SMCI was faking orders, this would mean that they likely have a growing inventory of AI chips. These would then be auctioned off, creating a surge in supply, competing with new orders.\n\n2. The duration of Nvidia's lead times can impact their margins and pricing power. If you have a 12 month lead time due to immense demand, you can hike prices. If that lead time shrinks to 1 month due to losing a significant customer, you have less margin to raise prices without impacting sales.\n\nThis scandal could also draw attention to other \"round tripping\" arrangements in the tech industry, in which circular transactions are set up in order to fake revenue growth. This could very much be the start of the unraveling of a bubble.\n\nThis isn't going to bankrupt Nvidia, they still have incredibly successful products and other customers, but it could definitely lead to a case where earnings growth stagnates, or is not sufficient enough to justify their current share price.\n\nDespite this tremendous threat, Nvidia is down just 1% today, which is well within its normal volatility. The market is not responding to this new information appropriately.",

I want you regards to think about this for more than half a second before you say the first thing that comes to your degenerate minds.\n\nBefore you read this, keep in mind Robinhood stock $HOOD has been on a run, up 70% in the past 3 months. \n\nI am a regarded Robinhood user myself. I signed up for Robinhood Gold in July of this year for all of the attractive perks (no, not those attractive perks Diddy) that they offer:\n\n• 4.5% interest on uninvested cash (was 5% until the FED cut rates)\n• 3.0% IRA Contribution match\n• 1.0% Deposit match\n• $1k of interest-free margin\n• Level 2 Market Data\n\nIn addition to these perks, Robinhood has launched a new advanced desktop trading platform (Robinhood Legend) and also offers a new credit card exclusively for Gold members that earns 3% cash back on all purchases, which is pretty rare. I think it is bullish that they are offering an unprecedented amount of cash back on all purchases - they must be doing pretty well to be able to offer this, right? And the only way to gain access to this credit card is through signing up for Robinhood gold.\n\nI think Robinhood’s platform is likely the preferred choice for the younger investor due to its easy to use and intuitive interface. It’s like the iPhone of stock trading apps. But, with these new offerings from Robinhood, including their new advanced trading platform, I could see it appealing to more and more older investors and retaining a higher percentage of their users as they get older, while continuing to be the preferred choice for the younger investor.\n\nRobinhood got me to sign up for Gold this summer. I am enjoying the perks and am confident I am making more money with these perks than what I am paying to have access to these perks ($5 per month). I think Robinhood’s platform is the most user friendly and easy to use. \n\nThat is why I am long $HOOD. Although the stock is on a 70% run over the past 3 months, I believe the stock will moon after their Q3 earnings report is released. Who is with me? Who is against me? Anybody buying Puts? Let me hear your honest thoughts on the stock you regards.\n\nJk, let’s all just buy FD’s\n\nGoing to wait until just before market close to load up on 11/1 $30c",

Today, we faced fewer headwinds than any point in our history. We're heading into 2025 with the most favorable conditions of the last seven years with declining rates and a stable economy.\n* We continue to establish SoFi as a trusted household name. We ended Q3 with our highest average unaided brand awareness of all time, up nearly 40% year-over-year to 7%. \n* We continue to innovate so people find unique value when they use our products. \n* We also launched our new directed share program, which offers a modern and streamlined approach to equity programs for companies looking to raise capital through IPOs.\n* SoFi Plus, our premium membership tier and our beta testing a new fee-based subscription option in the coming months.\n* In credit cards, we officially launched the everyday cash rewards and the essential credit cards, enabling SoFi to serve more people spending and borrowing needs,\n* We shift towards even more fee-based, capital-light, and lower-risk sources of revenue.\n* We also signed our first two direct insurance carriers for SoFi Protect, complementing our comprehensive financial services offering we've built over the last five years.\n* Home refinancing volume was the highest we've seen since the second quarter of 2022.\n* In our tech platform, we signed several new partnerships, including processing deals with two charter banks in Mexico and a deployment of Galileo's Cyber Bancorp for SoFi's new commercial payment services sponsored bank program.\n* We launched additional fraud prevention solutions, the Galileo instant verification engine, which we call GIVE as well as transaction risk GScore, both of which help clients enhance their security and operational efficiency.

We generate cash fees upfront at the time of transfer or referral without taking balance sheet risk. Importantly, there are no financing commitments or loss share agreements associated with these deals.\n* There is a 220 basis points difference between the interest we pay on deposits and the interest we pay on warehouse lines, which translates to more than $500 million in annualized interest expense savings given the size of our deposit base.\n* We expect modest growth in balance sheet originations year-over-year. We are happy with the current size of our balance sheet and the net interest income generated. Excess demand from borrowers and loan investors is being fulfilled through our loan platform business. We expect growth in student loan refinancing and home loans in a lower rate environment.\n* Recent (loan) vintages are projected to produce higher returns, with ROEs above 30%. This is driven by lower expected life of loan loss rates, higher pricing beta, funding cost efficiencies, and origination fees.\n* We expect continued strong growth in the loan platform business, with commitments from Fortress and other partners. Demand is strong, and we are fulfilling it through the loan platform business.\n* For the full year 2024, we now expect to deliver adjusted net revenue of $2.535 billion to $2.550 billion, which is $85 million higher than our prior guidance range of $2.425 billion to $2.465 billion. This implies 22% to 23% annual growth versus 17% to 19% previously. This guidance assumes lending revenue will be at least 100% of 2023 levels.\n* Financial Services will grow more than 80% year-over-year and tech platform will grow low to upper teens percent year-over-year.\n* GAAP EPS of $0.11 to $0.12 per share above prior guidance of $0.09 to $0.10 per share.\n\n[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q3-2024-sofi-technologies-inc-051725199.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q3-2024-sofi-technologies-inc-051725199.html)",

        "content": "From an article yesterday on Yahoo Finance courtesy of Insider Monkey, the day before Ernst & Young resigns as their accountant and the stock drops by 1/3. The stock market lottery has a surprise around every corner. Long, short, whatever you want, there's a chance. If this convinced you to get back in yesterday, what a surprise was in store today.  \n\n\nSuper Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is an unstoppable stock that could make you richer as it is developing high-performance server and storage solutions that are in high demand amid the artificial intelligence race and digital revolution. It is turning out to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom as it makes computers that companies use as servers for data storage.\n\nAt the start of 2024, Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) held just 6% of the worldwide server market. Selling liquid-cooled, high-performance servers for demanding computing tasks has allowed it to carve out a niche for itself. Because of this, Nvidia found Supermicro to be a perfect partner and provided it with top-tier data center GPUs to aid in producing dedicated AI servers.\n\nThough not exclusive, its strategic partnership with Nvidia has strengthened its competitive edge in the server market. Super Micro’s revenue more than quadrupled from $3.6 billion in fiscal 2021 to $14.9 billion in fiscal 2024, coinciding with the generative AI market’s explosive growth. Additionally, its earnings per share (EPS) increased by almost ten times. More than half of its revenue now comes from AI servers.\n\nThe confirmation that Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) is shipping more than 100,000 graphics processing units used for artificial intelligence underlines the strong demand that could translate into billions of dollars in revenues. Like other cloud service providers, Super Micro claimed to have recently installed over 100,000 GPUs with liquid cooling for some of the largest AI factories ever built.\n\nThe soaring GPU orders are one of the reasons analysts remain bullish about Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), with an average price target of $64.22, implying a 33.40% upside potential as of October 25, 2024. As per Insider Monkey’s Q2 2024 database, the company was in the portfolios of 47 hedge funds.\n\n[Scout Investments, Inc](https://www.insidermonkey.com/institutional-investor/scout-investments-inc/20489/), an affiliate of [Carillon Tower Advisers](https://www.insidermonkey.com/institutional-investor/carillon-tower-advisers-inc/1984690/), released a second-quarter 2024 investor letter. [**Here**](https://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/super-micro-computer-smci-fell-after-disappointing-earnings-guidance-1348885/) is what the fund said:\n\n>\n\nOverall SMCI **ranks 8th** on our list of 8 Unstoppable Stocks That Could Make You Richer. While we acknowledge the potential of SMCI as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "score": 29,
        "url": "https://open.substack.com/pub/andrew310743/p/flying-too-close-to-the-sun?utm_source=app-post-stats-page&r=1rwlhn&utm_medium=iosj",
        "content": "Had a pitch on PLTR from last Friday. Now that there’s this much insider selling that’s the nail in the coffin. Here’s the pitch for those interested: \nRecommendation: I recommend a short on Palantir Technologies. The stock is currently priced at $44.79 per share, which I believe will drop by about 20-30% in the next 6–12 months. This is because, the market is highly exuberant in regards to PLTR, pricing in extreme growth rates despite signs of stunting commercial growth. Additionally, overreliance on cyclical government contracts as well as downward pressure on margins due to new AI product launches has led me to believe PLTR is overvalued, which I will prove via this pitch.\nCompany Background: Palantir at its core is a company that focuses on data-analytics, specializing in integrating large amounts of data and operationalizing that data for the public and private sectors. Its speciality lies in the extreme flexibility it provides customers in the form of Forward Deployed Engineers (FDE’s), who can create bespoke AI solutions for any customer. The key platforms are:\nGotham, a government intelligence and geospatial platform that is meant to analyze data from various sources to help support military operations and disaster response. Foundry, the commercial segment of the business: This begins with the cleaning and structuring of data, which leads into the integration of this data into AI models (AIP). These models are meant to operationalize company data improving top level decision making. Apollo integrates these systems delivering infrastructure and continual updates.\nThe advantage of this system is two-fold: First is the “ontology”, an effective digital twin of the business, which allows 1. collaboration across departments and 2. The ability to reason across data and create automations and decision making processes from it (Operationalizing data differentiates PLTR from Snowflake and Databricks which focus on simple storage and basic data analytics). The second is the labor-intensive approach in which the company deploys engineers on-site to negotiate data access, clean that data and build extremely customizable and mission critical infrastructure (Creates high switching costs)\nTo give a brief financial overview, PLTR expects to report 2.8B in net sales, which translates to 2.2B (82.5% Gross Margin) in gross profit, 1B in EBIT (35.4% Operation Margin) and 950M in FCF (34.3% FCF Margin).\nMost recently PLTR reported revenue of 678.1M (up 27% YoY), beating consensus by 3.8% (563.2M). Guidance was raised 4% for Q3 and 3% for FY2024. This seems aggressive considering that this raise in guidance is larger than the beat just posted. Thus, as expectations grow towards the moon, significant earnings beats will be required for PLTR to continue rising\nInvestment Thesis: Markets are skewing towards exuberance on PLTR, pricing in absolute perfection and unachievable growth for 3 key reasons. \nFirst let’s get a lay of the land with valuation multiples. Palantir is trading at an exuberant valuation multiple of 39x sales, surpassing even the largest monopolies and industry players:\nNVIDIA, probably the hottest stock at the moment, has monopolized over 90% of the GPU market–a necessary prerequisite to our AI revolution, 62% operating margins and revenue growth of 126% in 2024E trades at 35x sales. Databricks, the current leader in data analytics, traded at about 26x sales (And this was during the peak of the SaaS market when Q4 2023 earnings faked out investors). Snowflake, often considered overvalued by investors, trades at around 11x sales.\nSo–Does Palantir have a stronger monopoly than Nvidia, more recurring revenue than Databricks, stickier revenue than Snowflake? The answer is no.\nProponents of PLTR often tout individual cases of companies loving their product, but let’s look at it from the top. Net Revenue Retention (NRR) is one of the most popular KPI’s for SaaS companies, essentially saying do customers spend more every year on the product? In other words, have customers loved the product so much that they increase their usage the next year? The answer for PLTR–kind of? Palantir's NRR stands at approximately 110%, down from 115% two years earlier, demonstrating a poor ability to upsell and retain customers. In contrast, Snowflake boasts an NRR of 130% this year and 150% last year when its EV/Sales multiple was at 10x and 20x respectively. This suggests that cheaper competitors not only have higher revenue quality but also more robust growth prospects.\nNext, let’s look at if the current growth prospects are even justified: Unfortunately, Palantir's commercial customer growth is already slowing. A few notes here: Firstly, The number of new commercial customers added has declined from 57 in Q1 to 39 in Q2. Secondly, Palantir's Bootcamp program, which aims to onboard new customers, has seen participant numbers drop from around 350 to about 110. Thirdly, the last beat on commercial revenue was largely due to one-time boosts in revenue (For example, they invested into a few SPAC’s previously as they were using foundry, which did quite well)\nOn the government side, growth has been pretty strong (Though not strong enough) and drove almost 100% of the consensus beat. However, management noted that the segment benefited the “favorable” deal timing dynamics, implying potential growth slowdown in future quarters.\nFurthermore, margins are likely to be depressed in the next few earnings calls: PLTR has announced the release of a new product recently. Analysts noted that this would depress margins in the upcoming report. However, an additional feature was announced 3 weeks ago that likely had significant opex expenses associated that haven’t been priced in considering recent rallies in the stock. \nFinally, there is increasing competition in the AI analytics space (Think Databricks, Snowflake and even companies like Airtable), making it easier and easier to process and operationalize unstructured data. At the end of the day, there simply aren’t that many use cases for an extremely expensive labor intensive service, which cannot move downmarket no matter how well-loved the service is (As well to organizations with well endowed data science teams).\nThe realization of any of these notes in earnings reports as well as a resolution in any of the geopolitical issues that the US is attached to today could be a turn in investor sentiment and enormous room to the downside. Additionally, macro risks to enterprise spending, intensified by the enormous cost of PLTR’s service create more downside risk.\nValuation: Based on a DCF analysis, to justify PLTR’s current pricing, the company needs to expand operating margin 6% by 2029, actually accelerate to a 30% growth rate (from 24%) by 2027 through 2029 as well as maintain a 20x EV/sales multiple (Assumed 14.5% discount rate). However, even in a bull case where we model a 2% beat on consensus revenue annually, and 6% margin expansion by 2029, we still arrive at $35 per share, a 20% drop from current levels.\nRisk Factors: The biggest risk here is related to the government sector. Specifically the DoD outlines in its 2024 plan a shift to larger-scale implementation and a focus on data and overall modernization of systems. This sounds like the DoD and PLTR are pretty lovey dovey, which could potentially spell higher valuations. Further, the escalation of more dormant issues, like that of China and Taiwan could lead to higher than expected spending and therefore contract signings.\nUnexpected commercial strength could also occur. Strong enterprise SaaS spending as rates drop could accelerate sales as well as new product launches. For example, Physical AI applications with the new Live Edge platform (focusing on manufacturing use cases) have been added. However, this is unlikely to bring in revenue until later in 2025.\nTo hedge against these risks, we could purchase call options, long various paired stocks or set a stop loss.\n",

Their platform's growth seems to be fueled by these AI partnerships, perhaps through features like real-time translations or enhanced content discovery.\n\n- Market Reaction: The financial markets have responded with enthusiasm. After Reddit's earnings beat expectations, shares reportedly jumped by up to 22%. Investors are clearly betting big on Reddit's AI strategy.\n\n\nWhat This Means for Reddit:\n\n- Future Revenue Streams: This could be just the beginning for Reddit. With more AI companies hungry for training data, Reddit's stock of user-generated content becomes increasingly valuable.\n\n- Innovation in User Experience: The partnerships might lead to innovative features on Reddit, making it not just a place for discussion but a hub for cutting-edge tech experiences.\n\n- Setting a Trend: Other social platforms might follow suit, but Reddit's early move here could cement its place in the AI ecosystem.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is this the right move for Reddit? How do you see this affecting the landscape of social media and AI? Let's discuss!\n\nReddit's shares are up due to lucrative AI data deals with companies like Google and OpenAI, hitting profitability, and growing its user base. They're leveraging their content for AI training, which might just redefine their role in tech.\n\n",

They essentially got to the point where they just added [dot.com](http://dot.com) to companies that never had a chance of profitability. Not only does NVDA have earnings but their main concern is just keeping up with demand. The only real concern I see about NVDA is whatever administration enters office within the start of the new year and how they deal with China and Taiwain especially because of Taiwains impact on the semi-condcutor industry with TSMC as the leading producer of semi-conductors especially because Intel cannot keep up and is being left behind.",
