        "content": "Congrats to those that followed my last Costco post. I don’t believe anyone can really predict the ups and downs of the market, and with the current market climbing past ATH’s, the safest bets are going to be balanced long-short positions in specific equities or spread bets. \n\n**Apple**\n\n* Market cap: 3.6T\n* Current P/E: \\~36\n* Average P/E last 5 years: 28.6\n* Historical revenue growth: Flat to single digits\n* Earnings growth: Low double digits\n* Net Margin: 25%\n\n **Microsoft**\n\n* Market cap: 3.2T\n* Microsoft P/E: \\~36\n* Average P/E last 5 years: 32.8\n* Historical revenue growth: 15%\n* Earnings growth: 15-20%\n* Net margin: 35%\n\nLast week, Apple had a higher P/E than MSFT, before this narrowed in the last few days Relative to Microsoft. Apple is still at historically high valuations relative to MSFT, despite Microsoft having better margins and growth. And the reasons are silly. Apple is getting a massive boost due to a \"potential supercycle\" with no proof that it’s actually happening (even the most optimistic projections are just slightly better than last year) and mediocre software releases, while Microsoft took a large hit last quarter because it forecasted larger capex and delays in direct GenAI revenue realization.\n\nIn my view, the market is pricing in a divergent and fundamental misunderstanding of GenAI and how it makes money. The Apple bull case hypothesis is correct, it’s just applied to the wrong company. The Microsoft supercycle isn’t going to be from direct GenAI subscriptions like Co-pilot, it’s going to be share shift towards Azure and increased utilization.\n\nTo me it is hopium to believe that retail consumers will be rushing aggressively to switch or upgrade their phones over a nascent GenAI capability that is inferior to its peers (other than privacy) and unlocks nominal value, while mid-large corporates won’t be doing the exact same for Microsoft for what is widely considered a top-notch set of capabilities and proven effectiveness in several emerging use cases.\n\nHere’s my prediction – regardless of where the market goes, I believe there is going to be a strong and continued divergence between Microsoft & Apple performance in the next few months, with at least another 5% gap between the winner and loser, with Microsoft’s P/E once against comfortably retaking the lead from Apple. Good luck and we'll see!\n\nTl;dr: Short Apple / Long Microsoft\n\nP.S. Seeing a lot of people triggered by the tl;dr recommendation not having a basic understanding of what long-short position is. A balanced long-short position doesn't mean I believe Apple will go down on nominal terms, just that it will go down relative to Microsoft. Using options or a long-short position is the way to extract value when you see the spread in two equities increase.  ",

        "content": "Microsoft has a very expensive and very public relationship with artificial intelligence startup OpenAI. But one of Microsoft’s most successful AI products, GitHub Copilot, is now going beyond OpenAI to give developers more choice in what models they want to use.\n\nGitHub, which Microsoft acquired in 2018, said in a blog post on Tuesday that developers will be able to power the GitHub Copilot Chat feature with Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model or Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro model, as alternatives to OpenAI’s GPT-4o, if they choose.\n\n“There is no one model to rule every scenario, and developers expect the agency to build with the models that work best for them,” GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke said in the post. “It is clear the next phase of AI code generation will not only be defined by multi-model functionality, but by multi-model choice. Today, we deliver just that.”\n\nMicrosoft introduced GitHub Copilot in 2021, offering source code suggestions to software developers. Copilot relies on models from OpenAI, which has received billions of dollars in funding from Microsoft and has exploded in popularity since releasing ChatGPT in late 2022.\n\nOpenAI’s o1-preview and o1-mini, which are meant to reason over difficult problems, will also be available in the Copilot Chat on GitHub’s website and in the open-source Visual Studio Code text editor. They’re currently available in a public preview. Google’s model will be released in public preview in the next few weeks, a spokesperson said.\n\nThe arrival of the o1 models from OpenAI in September led GitHub to look at adding a dropdown menu for Copilot to provide more options, Dohmke said in an interview with CNBC last week. At that point, it felt like “the right time” to add models from Anthropic and Google, Dohmke said.\n\nDevelopers will be able to see which model works best for a given programming language or employ the one that adheres to corporate requirements, he added.\n\nMany other Microsoft products, including Teams and Windows, use OpenAI models. And Microsoft continues to provide computing power to OpenAI, which is now valued at $157 billion. But the relationship between the two companies has frayed in the past year, following the sudden ouster and reinstatement of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in November. The dramatic incident reportedly angered Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.\n\nIn February, Microsoft announced a partnership with early-stage AI model developer Mistral. The following month, Microsoft said it was hiring former DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman and employees of his startup, Inflection, whose Pi assistant competed with OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT. Over the summer, Microsoft named OpenAI as a competitor in a regulatory filing.\n\nIn the past month, GitHub has collaborated with engineering teams from Anthropic and Google on the safety, security and scalability of their models, Dohmke said.\n\n“We are planning on extending that list in the future but have no partnerships to announce at this point,” he said, adding that GitHub wouldn’t want to overwhelm developers with too many choices.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, GitHub announced that its Copilot will gain the ability to perform speedy automated reviews of code updates through a public preview.\n\nAnd GitHub showed a technical preview of a feature named Spark that can compose app prototypes based on text input and refine the designs with a few clicks. Developers will be able to modify the underlying code for the prototypes. Those interested in trying Spark can join a waiting list.\n\nOnce they receive access, people using Spark will be able to choose between GPT-4o and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, a GitHub spokesperson said.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/microsoft-github-copilot-goes-past-openai-opens-to-anthropic-google.html",

        "content": "Apple announced on Tuesday new Mac Mini models, featuring the first major redesign since 2010 that makes the desktop computer significantly smaller.\n\nAside from a redesign that shrunk the case and reduced the computer’s volume in half, the main upgrade on these new computers is that they include Apple’s latest chip, either the M4, or a more powerful version called the M4 Pro.\n\nThe Mac Mini is Apple’s least-expensive Mac, starting at $599, and does not include a display, which is sold separately. When the product line was first introduced in 2008, it was marketed as a computer for people switching from Microsoft Windows who could simply plug their existing keyboard, mouse and monitor into their new silver box.\n\nThe Mac Mini is not one of Apple’s highest-volume computers in terms of sales, but it is an important slot in Apple’s lineup, especially for people who make apps for iPhones and other Apple platforms. Many iPhone developers like to run a Mac Mini as a personal development server for coordinating uploads and code.\n\nOne improvement in the new design is that all of the ports are USB-C ports, the same more modern offering found on Apple’s laptops. There are three USB-C ports on the rear and two on the front, a new addition that will make it easier to plug or unplug accessories while the computer rests on a desk.\n\nApple said in a press release that the M4 is a significant improvement over the M2 chip in the previous version released in 2022. Graphics and games are more than twice as fast, and the M4 can support up to 14 CPU cores and 20 GPU cores, an increase over the past generation. Apple first introduced the M4 in May in Apple’s iPad Pro.\n\nApple is framing the new Mac Minis, like all of its new products announced this year, as built for Apple Intelligence, the company’s artificial intelligence system released this week. Apple has said a forthcoming integration of ChatGPT into writing fields inside apps such as Word will allow users to generate and rewrite text and emails using the system.\n\nHowever, unlike on the iPhone, where only phones released in the past two years will support Apple Intelligence, all of Apple’s computers with the M1 chip and newer since 2020 can run the company’s AI. \n\nApple’s Mac family remains a large business segment even though it is less important to the company than the iPhone. In the June quarter, Apple reported $7 billion in Mac sales, up about 2% on an annual basis.\n\nApple’s chief marketer previously teased a “week of announcements.” The company unveiled new iMac computers on Monday, so it seems plausible more is coming. This week’s new Macs are likely Apple’s last major hardware announcements for the year.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/apple-mac-mini-2024-price-release-specs.html",

That puts annual exports on track to surpass the about $10 billion of fiscal 2024.\n\n> Apple is expanding its manufacturing network in India at a rapid clip, taking advantage of local subsidies, a skilled workforce and advances in the country’s technological capabilities. India is a crucial part of the company’s effort to lessen its reliance on China, where risks have grown along with Beijing’s tensions with the US.\n\n> Three of Apple’s suppliers — Taiwan’s Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp., and homegrown Tata Electronics — assemble iPhones in southern India. Foxconn’s local unit, based on the outskirts of Chennai, is the top supplier in India and accounts for half of the country’s iPhone exports.",

However, I have a very particular stock strategy that when I do see the stars align it works out well.  So if you are sick of losing and want a nice win that should net at least 40% gains then this is the one for you.\n\nNerdwallet is a website that relies on all monetization through their website. In their most recent 10-K (you don't need to worry about it its finance stuff) they said that **\"In 2023, over 70% of all traffic to NerdWallet came organically through direct or unpaid channels.\"** they then go on to say \"**we are dependent on internet search engines particularly Google... if our search results page rankings decline for other reasons, traffic to our platform or user growth or engagement could decline, any of which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\"**\n\nI think it's pretty clear they need Google visits for the business to survive. If you really care, you can go back through other previous earnings calls and see they mention traffic nearly every time.\n\nSo why does this matter and how do you make money? Every few months Google releases an update to their algorithm that determines how a website should show up. I know this is a massive oversimplification, so when you Google \"whats the best credit card for people with bad credit\" these companies make money when you go to their website and click through to a partner credit card offer.\n\nBut what happens when Google says NerdWallet you aren't as good as we thought you were and moves you down in rankings? For those not smart enough, if clicks go down money goes down. \n\n**So here are there expectations, to be better then Q3 of last year.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/odyjnvxrlqxd1.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=577c772611e98c61c4033982f222e102962cdf76\n\n**But what actually happened to NerdWallet website visits over the last 12 months?**\n\nAs you can see in Q1 of last year NerdWallet was at a high point. This lead into a increased expectation of the value in Q3/Q4 last year. However, note in Q2 and Q3 they got hit by Google and lost a significant amount of web visits.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/go437jjylqxd1.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=f815abc08eec2d9c94a1c3ecf89a98d4e29c3ec5\n\n**What's a real World example of this?**\n\nIf you Googled \"home equity loan rates\" last year, NerdWallet would show up on the first page of the results. Now, if you Google the same thing, they aren't there. \n\n**For those of you who like numbers, what does this actually mean when comparing quarter over quarter and even year over year?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1c78sdxemqxd1.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=224a23e405ae9657bac99a3f7701a3307c3e48ed\n\nBecause the market is closing soon I am not even going to get into all the headwinds and losses they will also take as a result of Google AI overviews. This is only going to threaten their business over the next 18 months.\n\n**My position: 11/15 Puts @ $15**",

Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year.\n\nThis report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure. With Nvidia's earnings report on the horizon, AMD's results offer a useful benchmark. \n\nAlthough AMD has significantly underperformed Nvidia year-to-date, this could be an opportunity to turn the tables.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ttdpcfwd7oxd1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ac44262179cb380f1b671b1403562c5d615e51f\n\n**Data Center Growth is Key**\n\nAnalysts predict AMD's data center revenue will reach a record $3.52 billion for Q3. In July, CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in strong revenue growth for the year's second half, driven by demand for Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. \n\nEarlier this month, AMD launched its latest data center AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, and investors are keen to see its performance.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari pointed to sustained growth in AI infrastructure capital expenditure, a recovery in server CPUs, and AMD's ongoing market share gains.

Companies see this, and will spend whatever it takes to build AGI. This creates a generational investment opportunity, particularly in two key areas: foundation model companies and datacenter infrastructure plays. I'm deploying \\~$100K with this thesis. I'd love your thoughts on this, and am looking to incorporate feedback.\n\n**The Thesis:**\n\nWe are witnessing the early stages of perhaps the most significant technological revolution in human history. The evidence suggests we're approaching an inflection point in artificial intelligence that will reshape the entire economy. Here's why this matters for investors:\n\n**Key Technical Developments:**\n\n* Transformer architecture has fundamentally solved previous algorithmic and data constraints\n* Larger models consistently demonstrate superior capabilities\n* Critical breakthrough in reasoning capabilities (building on techniques from game theory/poker)\n* Major capability jumps expected with upcoming models (GPT-5, Gemini-2)\n\nBusiness Implications:\n\n1. The Prize: Human intelligence and agency have historically been the greatest constraints on economic growth. AGI would effectively remove these constraints.\n2. Follow the Money:\n   * Current AI capex spending at big tech companies is >$150B annually\n   * For comparison: The tech bubble peak saw $250B/year in broadband infrastructure in today’s dollars\n   * Unlike the tech bubble, today's AI investments are being made by cash-rich tech giants with fortress balance sheets\n   * Training next-gen models will require hundreds of billions in compute investment\n3. The Economics Are Compelling:\n   * Leading tech companies each generate $100B+ in annual revenue\n   * They can invest off their balance sheet with extremely low cost of debt\n   * Early evidence shows strong ROI on AI investments (e.g., Microsoft/OpenAI revenue growth)\n\n  \n**Investment Strategy:** I'm deploying $100K across foundation model companies and datacenter infrastructure, with a small allocation to energy. Here's the detailed breakdown:\n\n[Overall Portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/9atytvnu6lxd1.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=9da96520090f2e014f5f1bd82af30eb67c1a8fca)\n\n* Foundation Model Companies (50%): Based on comprehensive benchmarking data from [LiveBench.ai](http://LiveBench.ai), weighted by demonstrated capabilities across reasoning, coding, mathematics, data analysis, language, and instruction following:\n\n[Foundation Model Weighting](https://preview.redd.it/qs43dkgc7lxd1.png?width=2900&format=png&auto=webp&s=04ed97a4b7e9f0111f944633fbf12f3ea9995ea7)\n\n   1. Google (Gemini-1.5-Pro): 11.77% \n   2. Microsoft (OpenAI Partnership): 10.66% \n   3. Amazon/Google (Anthropic Investment): 9.79%\n   4. Meta (LLaMA): 9.49% \n   5. Tesla (xAI): 8.30% \n* Datacenter Infrastructure (42%): Weighted according to typical datacenter capital expenditure breakdown:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u14rf0vi7lxd1.jpg?width=1126&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de34b7cdd3d81b7e017b0a06eed7a6102f8c2ddf\n\n   1. Servers/Compute: 31.47% Primary exposure through NVDA\n   2. Networking: 4.53% Split across CSCO, ANET, JNPR\n   3. Construction & Components: 5.99% Including:\n      * XLI ETF: Exposure to industrials that will be involved in building these datacenters\n* Energy Infrastructure (7.33%):\n   1. XLU ETF: Exposure to utilities that will power this buildout\n   2. This is based off datacenter variable (energy + colo) costs being approx 15% of the monthly cost of the datacenter, with the remaining being the capital costs of standing up the datacenter.\n\n  \n\n\n **An interesting catalyst for why I think now is the time to buy into this:**\n\nThere's going to be some foundation models that will be released over the next few months that will reconfirm the returns to scale for these models. [\\[1\\]](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278999/openai-plans-orion-ai-model-release-december)[\\[2\\] ](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279600/google-next-gemini-ai-model-openai-december) The truly exciting thing is that these models will be able to take actions to do tasks on your computer. The main issue in the current iteration of models is that they are not reliably able to do long running goal oriented tasks, but the release of o1 changed my perspective on this problem. That model has been trained to go through chain-of-thought steps to get to the right answer, and its data will be used to train larger models on the entire reasoning sequence. This unlocks a whole bunch of learnable training data. Things are going to get even more exciting.   \nI've been working on language models since GPT-1/BERT/etc, and the main thing is that every time a model comes out, we're all surprised at how much better it gets. I've learned to not be as skeptical of the returns to scale, and I'm finally putting (more) of my money where my mouth is. ",

I do NOT edit videos, photos or game on my Mac in a producing way, but only for personal use (trimming a video or adjusting light on a photo). It is only my media consumption, personal document storing/viewing, iCloud synching device that I use for the things I prefer to do on a bigger screen. I use Pages to write docs, and Keynote to prepare presentations, and more than half of my SSD is empty. \n\nMy most hardcore use-case scenario is when I mix music as a bedroom DJ, during which I even keep the Mac unplugged AND Low-Power Mode despite the DJ applications usually being demanding on resources. During such rare occasions, my battery only drops to 80% after 2-3 hours of continues mixing which is still far better than any other windows laptop I used before this beast, temps only rise to “lukewarm” but performance stays the same with less than 20% CPU utilisation. \n\nAlthough the new base model Macs are being announced minimum 16GB RAM, this thing is still enough to provide full power for my (and possibly many of users) needs and WILL get Apple Intelligence. \n\nSimply the Best.Purchase.Ever.\n\n\n\nCheers.",

Lately, it's mostly for the occasional online shopping, but even then, I mostly use my phone unless it’s for bigger purchases like flights.\n\nI’m thinking of maybe taking some online courses in data/stat analysis down the line through DataCamp, so I’d like to keep something around \"just in case.\" But with my usage dropping, a work laptop at hand, and my own M1 iPad Pro, I’ve been considering a trade-in for something that fits my needs better:\n\n- New M4 Mini: Smaller footprint but still something I could keep on my desk.\n\n- 13-inch MacBook Air: Either wait for the M4 or go with the M3.  The current 16-inch MacBook Pro I have is a bit big for me now.\n\n- M4 iPad Pro: Trading in my M1 iPad Pro and MacBook for it and going all-in. This would be my main device besides my phone, and it can handle everything I need. I also use my iPad for work notes during meetings, streaming on the go, and as my travel “computer” when I visit family. However, when I think of this option it feels weird to me not having some sort of laptop/computer that's not a tablet.\n\nI would appreciate any advice as I have been going back and forth on this recently.",

Then it restarted on its own. \n\nIt’s been almost 2 hours and whenever I try to shut the machine down, it shuts down properly but then restarts almost immediately out of nowhere. Tried this 3x thinking this was user error but nope, it does it automatically.\n\nIt’s been upside down this whole time (screen laying flat on my bed and strong fan aimed directly at upside down keyboard with mac vents facing down). Currently on sleep mode since mac won’t shut down as it restarts every time a shutdown is attempted.\n\nWhat should I do? Any help is greatly appreciated. I’ll probably be going to the apple store tomorrow morning for a diagnostic. I dont have applecare so the fee for Apple to fix it is probably something I can’t afford right now. ",

        "content": "(Note: Apologies for the formatting, I am on mobile.)\n\nHey all, my dad asked me a few weeks ago to look into investing for him. My dad is 63, debt free, owns several rental properties, a few HYSAs (cash totaling ~400k) and is wanting to invest about 50-75k if possible (we will likely start out smaller though).\n\nThe thing is, my dad is an immigrant who did not go to high school or college & does not speak a lot of English so a lot of these finance things (such as HYSA, Roth IRA, etc) he did not know about until way later in his life and there are not as many good resources on investing in Spanish (especially US-specific advice) as there are in English.\n\nAdmittedly, I’m not well versed in investing at all (22F, I went to business school in university, but unless you’re a finance major, everything was kind of brushed over). My dad has never contributed to his Roth IRA (I know, I know) so I was thinking of maxing that out first and then doing the rest in a brokerage. I tried to do research from lots of different sources and here is an asset allocation I came up with, please let me know your thoughts:\n\n\nEquities (Index Funds & ETFS): 60%\n- For about 45%, I’d probably do a mixture of VOO, FXAIX, and FSKAX. Generally stable and have some growth potential\n- For the remaining 15%, I was thinking something like QQQ. A little more volatile hence why I’m allocating a lower percentage but stronger growth potential\n\nBonds (ETFs or Short Term Bonds): 40%\n- For about 25%, I was thinking of doing a total bond market ETF (such as BND) to balance out equity market risks\n- For about 15%, I was thinking Short Term Bonds like VGSH or SHY. More liquid and adding more stability to make the portfolio less sensitive to rate changes\n\n\nIs this optimal? Or should I do a different allocation in the Roth IRA? Another option I was thinking possibly to also do purely Equities in the Roth IRA since it has tax advantages, and the allocation above for the remaining amount in the brokerage account. \n\nSo that’s what I was able to gather keeping my dad’s age in mind. My dad’s goal isn’t necessarily to make crazy insane gains, mostly just to keep more of his money moving and get a decent ROI, preferably better than his HYSAs. My brother tried him on Crypto in 2021 (thankfully only about $1k invested) and he lost about 1/3 of his investment after 3 years so I really don’t wanna fuck this up for him. I wish I learned more about investing sooner (and I’m still learning by the day), but it all just seemed like so much to wrap my head around with a big learning curve, so it intimidated me and I didn’t know where to look back then. \n\nLet me know your thoughts on the asset allocation and thanks for reading til here! \n",
