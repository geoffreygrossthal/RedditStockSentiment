        "content": "Congrats to those that followed my last Costco post. I don’t believe anyone can really predict the ups and downs of the market, and with the current market climbing past ATH’s, the safest bets are going to be balanced long-short positions in specific equities or spread bets. \n\n**Apple**\n\n* Market cap: 3.6T\n* Current P/E: \\~36\n* Average P/E last 5 years: 28.6\n* Historical revenue growth: Flat to single digits\n* Earnings growth: Low double digits\n* Net Margin: 25%\n\n **Microsoft**\n\n* Market cap: 3.2T\n* Microsoft P/E: \\~36\n* Average P/E last 5 years: 32.8\n* Historical revenue growth: 15%\n* Earnings growth: 15-20%\n* Net margin: 35%\n\nLast week, Apple had a higher P/E than MSFT, before this narrowed in the last few days Relative to Microsoft. Apple is still at historically high valuations relative to MSFT, despite Microsoft having better margins and growth. And the reasons are silly. Apple is getting a massive boost due to a \"potential supercycle\" with no proof that it’s actually happening (even the most optimistic projections are just slightly better than last year) and mediocre software releases, while Microsoft took a large hit last quarter because it forecasted larger capex and delays in direct GenAI revenue realization.\n\nIn my view, the market is pricing in a divergent and fundamental misunderstanding of GenAI and how it makes money. The Apple bull case hypothesis is correct, it’s just applied to the wrong company. The Microsoft supercycle isn’t going to be from direct GenAI subscriptions like Co-pilot, it’s going to be share shift towards Azure and increased utilization.\n\nTo me it is hopium to believe that retail consumers will be rushing aggressively to switch or upgrade their phones over a nascent GenAI capability that is inferior to its peers (other than privacy) and unlocks nominal value, while mid-large corporates won’t be doing the exact same for Microsoft for what is widely considered a top-notch set of capabilities and proven effectiveness in several emerging use cases.\n\nHere’s my prediction – regardless of where the market goes, I believe there is going to be a strong and continued divergence between Microsoft & Apple performance in the next few months, with at least another 5% gap between the winner and loser, with Microsoft’s P/E once against comfortably retaking the lead from Apple. Good luck and we'll see!\n\nTl;dr: Short Apple / Long Microsoft\n\nP.S. Seeing a lot of people triggered by the tl;dr recommendation not having a basic understanding of what long-short position is. A balanced long-short position doesn't mean I believe Apple will go down on nominal terms, just that it will go down relative to Microsoft. Using options or a long-short position is the way to extract value when you see the spread in two equities increase.  ",

        "content": "Microsoft has a very expensive and very public relationship with artificial intelligence startup OpenAI. But one of Microsoft’s most successful AI products, GitHub Copilot, is now going beyond OpenAI to give developers more choice in what models they want to use.\n\nGitHub, which Microsoft acquired in 2018, said in a blog post on Tuesday that developers will be able to power the GitHub Copilot Chat feature with Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model or Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro model, as alternatives to OpenAI’s GPT-4o, if they choose.\n\n“There is no one model to rule every scenario, and developers expect the agency to build with the models that work best for them,” GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke said in the post. “It is clear the next phase of AI code generation will not only be defined by multi-model functionality, but by multi-model choice. Today, we deliver just that.”\n\nMicrosoft introduced GitHub Copilot in 2021, offering source code suggestions to software developers. Copilot relies on models from OpenAI, which has received billions of dollars in funding from Microsoft and has exploded in popularity since releasing ChatGPT in late 2022.\n\nOpenAI’s o1-preview and o1-mini, which are meant to reason over difficult problems, will also be available in the Copilot Chat on GitHub’s website and in the open-source Visual Studio Code text editor. They’re currently available in a public preview. Google’s model will be released in public preview in the next few weeks, a spokesperson said.\n\nThe arrival of the o1 models from OpenAI in September led GitHub to look at adding a dropdown menu for Copilot to provide more options, Dohmke said in an interview with CNBC last week. At that point, it felt like “the right time” to add models from Anthropic and Google, Dohmke said.\n\nDevelopers will be able to see which model works best for a given programming language or employ the one that adheres to corporate requirements, he added.\n\nMany other Microsoft products, including Teams and Windows, use OpenAI models. And Microsoft continues to provide computing power to OpenAI, which is now valued at $157 billion. But the relationship between the two companies has frayed in the past year, following the sudden ouster and reinstatement of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in November. The dramatic incident reportedly angered Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.\n\nIn February, Microsoft announced a partnership with early-stage AI model developer Mistral. The following month, Microsoft said it was hiring former DeepMind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman and employees of his startup, Inflection, whose Pi assistant competed with OpenAI’s popular ChatGPT. Over the summer, Microsoft named OpenAI as a competitor in a regulatory filing.\n\nIn the past month, GitHub has collaborated with engineering teams from Anthropic and Google on the safety, security and scalability of their models, Dohmke said.\n\n“We are planning on extending that list in the future but have no partnerships to announce at this point,” he said, adding that GitHub wouldn’t want to overwhelm developers with too many choices.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, GitHub announced that its Copilot will gain the ability to perform speedy automated reviews of code updates through a public preview.\n\nAnd GitHub showed a technical preview of a feature named Spark that can compose app prototypes based on text input and refine the designs with a few clicks. Developers will be able to modify the underlying code for the prototypes. Those interested in trying Spark can join a waiting list.\n\nOnce they receive access, people using Spark will be able to choose between GPT-4o and Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, a GitHub spokesperson said.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/microsoft-github-copilot-goes-past-openai-opens-to-anthropic-google.html",

        "content": "Apple announced on Tuesday new Mac Mini models, featuring the first major redesign since 2010 that makes the desktop computer significantly smaller.\n\nAside from a redesign that shrunk the case and reduced the computer’s volume in half, the main upgrade on these new computers is that they include Apple’s latest chip, either the M4, or a more powerful version called the M4 Pro.\n\nThe Mac Mini is Apple’s least-expensive Mac, starting at $599, and does not include a display, which is sold separately. When the product line was first introduced in 2008, it was marketed as a computer for people switching from Microsoft Windows who could simply plug their existing keyboard, mouse and monitor into their new silver box.\n\nThe Mac Mini is not one of Apple’s highest-volume computers in terms of sales, but it is an important slot in Apple’s lineup, especially for people who make apps for iPhones and other Apple platforms. Many iPhone developers like to run a Mac Mini as a personal development server for coordinating uploads and code.\n\nOne improvement in the new design is that all of the ports are USB-C ports, the same more modern offering found on Apple’s laptops. There are three USB-C ports on the rear and two on the front, a new addition that will make it easier to plug or unplug accessories while the computer rests on a desk.\n\nApple said in a press release that the M4 is a significant improvement over the M2 chip in the previous version released in 2022. Graphics and games are more than twice as fast, and the M4 can support up to 14 CPU cores and 20 GPU cores, an increase over the past generation. Apple first introduced the M4 in May in Apple’s iPad Pro.\n\nApple is framing the new Mac Minis, like all of its new products announced this year, as built for Apple Intelligence, the company’s artificial intelligence system released this week. Apple has said a forthcoming integration of ChatGPT into writing fields inside apps such as Word will allow users to generate and rewrite text and emails using the system.\n\nHowever, unlike on the iPhone, where only phones released in the past two years will support Apple Intelligence, all of Apple’s computers with the M1 chip and newer since 2020 can run the company’s AI. \n\nApple’s Mac family remains a large business segment even though it is less important to the company than the iPhone. In the June quarter, Apple reported $7 billion in Mac sales, up about 2% on an annual basis.\n\nApple’s chief marketer previously teased a “week of announcements.” The company unveiled new iMac computers on Monday, so it seems plausible more is coming. This week’s new Macs are likely Apple’s last major hardware announcements for the year.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/29/apple-mac-mini-2024-price-release-specs.html",

That puts annual exports on track to surpass the about $10 billion of fiscal 2024.\n\n> Apple is expanding its manufacturing network in India at a rapid clip, taking advantage of local subsidies, a skilled workforce and advances in the country’s technological capabilities. India is a crucial part of the company’s effort to lessen its reliance on China, where risks have grown along with Beijing’s tensions with the US.\n\n> Three of Apple’s suppliers — Taiwan’s Foxconn Technology Group and Pegatron Corp., and homegrown Tata Electronics — assemble iPhones in southern India. Foxconn’s local unit, based on the outskirts of Chennai, is the top supplier in India and accounts for half of the country’s iPhone exports.",

However, I have a very particular stock strategy that when I do see the stars align it works out well.  So if you are sick of losing and want a nice win that should net at least 40% gains then this is the one for you.\n\nNerdwallet is a website that relies on all monetization through their website. In their most recent 10-K (you don't need to worry about it its finance stuff) they said that **\"In 2023, over 70% of all traffic to NerdWallet came organically through direct or unpaid channels.\"** they then go on to say \"**we are dependent on internet search engines particularly Google... if our search results page rankings decline for other reasons, traffic to our platform or user growth or engagement could decline, any of which would harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\"**\n\nI think it's pretty clear they need Google visits for the business to survive. If you really care, you can go back through other previous earnings calls and see they mention traffic nearly every time.\n\nSo why does this matter and how do you make money? Every few months Google releases an update to their algorithm that determines how a website should show up. I know this is a massive oversimplification, so when you Google \"whats the best credit card for people with bad credit\" these companies make money when you go to their website and click through to a partner credit card offer.\n\nBut what happens when Google says NerdWallet you aren't as good as we thought you were and moves you down in rankings? For those not smart enough, if clicks go down money goes down. \n\n**So here are there expectations, to be better then Q3 of last year.**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/odyjnvxrlqxd1.png?width=1066&format=png&auto=webp&s=577c772611e98c61c4033982f222e102962cdf76\n\n**But what actually happened to NerdWallet website visits over the last 12 months?**\n\nAs you can see in Q1 of last year NerdWallet was at a high point. This lead into a increased expectation of the value in Q3/Q4 last year. However, note in Q2 and Q3 they got hit by Google and lost a significant amount of web visits.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/go437jjylqxd1.png?width=1161&format=png&auto=webp&s=f815abc08eec2d9c94a1c3ecf89a98d4e29c3ec5\n\n**What's a real World example of this?**\n\nIf you Googled \"home equity loan rates\" last year, NerdWallet would show up on the first page of the results. Now, if you Google the same thing, they aren't there. \n\n**For those of you who like numbers, what does this actually mean when comparing quarter over quarter and even year over year?**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1c78sdxemqxd1.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=224a23e405ae9657bac99a3f7701a3307c3e48ed\n\nBecause the market is closing soon I am not even going to get into all the headwinds and losses they will also take as a result of Google AI overviews. This is only going to threaten their business over the next 18 months.\n\n**My position: 11/15 Puts @ $15**",

Wall Street analysts project that AMD will report earnings of $0.91 per share, marking a 30% year-over-year increase, with revenues expected at $6.71 billion—a 15.7% increase from the same period last year.\n\nThis report is particularly critical for analysts assessing AI demand trends. As Nvidia's primary competitor, AMD's GPUs play an essential role in AI training infrastructure. With Nvidia's earnings report on the horizon, AMD's results offer a useful benchmark. \n\nAlthough AMD has significantly underperformed Nvidia year-to-date, this could be an opportunity to turn the tables.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ttdpcfwd7oxd1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ac44262179cb380f1b671b1403562c5d615e51f\n\n**Data Center Growth is Key**\n\nAnalysts predict AMD's data center revenue will reach a record $3.52 billion for Q3. In July, CEO Lisa Su expressed confidence in strong revenue growth for the year's second half, driven by demand for Instinct, EPYC, and Ryzen processors. \n\nEarlier this month, AMD launched its latest data center AI chip, the Instinct MI325X, and investors are keen to see its performance.\n\nGoldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari pointed to sustained growth in AI infrastructure capital expenditure, a recovery in server CPUs, and AMD's ongoing market share gains.

Companies see this, and will spend whatever it takes to build AGI. This creates a generational investment opportunity, particularly in two key areas: foundation model companies and datacenter infrastructure plays. I'm deploying \\~$100K with this thesis. I'd love your thoughts on this, and am looking to incorporate feedback.\n\n**The Thesis:**\n\nWe are witnessing the early stages of perhaps the most significant technological revolution in human history. The evidence suggests we're approaching an inflection point in artificial intelligence that will reshape the entire economy. Here's why this matters for investors:\n\n**Key Technical Developments:**\n\n* Transformer architecture has fundamentally solved previous algorithmic and data constraints\n* Larger models consistently demonstrate superior capabilities\n* Critical breakthrough in reasoning capabilities (building on techniques from game theory/poker)\n* Major capability jumps expected with upcoming models (GPT-5, Gemini-2)\n\nBusiness Implications:\n\n1. The Prize: Human intelligence and agency have historically been the greatest constraints on economic growth. AGI would effectively remove these constraints.\n2. Follow the Money:\n   * Current AI capex spending at big tech companies is >$150B annually\n   * For comparison: The tech bubble peak saw $250B/year in broadband infrastructure in today’s dollars\n   * Unlike the tech bubble, today's AI investments are being made by cash-rich tech giants with fortress balance sheets\n   * Training next-gen models will require hundreds of billions in compute investment\n3. The Economics Are Compelling:\n   * Leading tech companies each generate $100B+ in annual revenue\n   * They can invest off their balance sheet with extremely low cost of debt\n   * Early evidence shows strong ROI on AI investments (e.g., Microsoft/OpenAI revenue growth)\n\n  \n**Investment Strategy:** I'm deploying $100K across foundation model companies and datacenter infrastructure, with a small allocation to energy. Here's the detailed breakdown:\n\n[Overall Portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/9atytvnu6lxd1.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=9da96520090f2e014f5f1bd82af30eb67c1a8fca)\n\n* Foundation Model Companies (50%): Based on comprehensive benchmarking data from [LiveBench.ai](http://LiveBench.ai), weighted by demonstrated capabilities across reasoning, coding, mathematics, data analysis, language, and instruction following:\n\n[Foundation Model Weighting](https://preview.redd.it/qs43dkgc7lxd1.png?width=2900&format=png&auto=webp&s=04ed97a4b7e9f0111f944633fbf12f3ea9995ea7)\n\n   1. Google (Gemini-1.5-Pro): 11.77% \n   2. Microsoft (OpenAI Partnership): 10.66% \n   3. Amazon/Google (Anthropic Investment): 9.79%\n   4. Meta (LLaMA): 9.49% \n   5. Tesla (xAI): 8.30% \n* Datacenter Infrastructure (42%): Weighted according to typical datacenter capital expenditure breakdown:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u14rf0vi7lxd1.jpg?width=1126&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de34b7cdd3d81b7e017b0a06eed7a6102f8c2ddf\n\n   1. Servers/Compute: 31.47% Primary exposure through NVDA\n   2. Networking: 4.53% Split across CSCO, ANET, JNPR\n   3. Construction & Components: 5.99% Including:\n      * XLI ETF: Exposure to industrials that will be involved in building these datacenters\n* Energy Infrastructure (7.33%):\n   1. XLU ETF: Exposure to utilities that will power this buildout\n   2. This is based off datacenter variable (energy + colo) costs being approx 15% of the monthly cost of the datacenter, with the remaining being the capital costs of standing up the datacenter.\n\n  \n\n\n **An interesting catalyst for why I think now is the time to buy into this:**\n\nThere's going to be some foundation models that will be released over the next few months that will reconfirm the returns to scale for these models. [\\[1\\]](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278999/openai-plans-orion-ai-model-release-december)[\\[2\\] ](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/25/24279600/google-next-gemini-ai-model-openai-december) The truly exciting thing is that these models will be able to take actions to do tasks on your computer. The main issue in the current iteration of models is that they are not reliably able to do long running goal oriented tasks, but the release of o1 changed my perspective on this problem. That model has been trained to go through chain-of-thought steps to get to the right answer, and its data will be used to train larger models on the entire reasoning sequence. This unlocks a whole bunch of learnable training data. Things are going to get even more exciting.   \nI've been working on language models since GPT-1/BERT/etc, and the main thing is that every time a model comes out, we're all surprised at how much better it gets. I've learned to not be as skeptical of the returns to scale, and I'm finally putting (more) of my money where my mouth is. ",

I do NOT edit videos, photos or game on my Mac in a producing way, but only for personal use (trimming a video or adjusting light on a photo). It is only my media consumption, personal document storing/viewing, iCloud synching device that I use for the things I prefer to do on a bigger screen. I use Pages to write docs, and Keynote to prepare presentations, and more than half of my SSD is empty. \n\nMy most hardcore use-case scenario is when I mix music as a bedroom DJ, during which I even keep the Mac unplugged AND Low-Power Mode despite the DJ applications usually being demanding on resources. During such rare occasions, my battery only drops to 80% after 2-3 hours of continues mixing which is still far better than any other windows laptop I used before this beast, temps only rise to “lukewarm” but performance stays the same with less than 20% CPU utilisation. \n\nAlthough the new base model Macs are being announced minimum 16GB RAM, this thing is still enough to provide full power for my (and possibly many of users) needs and WILL get Apple Intelligence. \n\nSimply the Best.Purchase.Ever.\n\n\n\nCheers.",

Lately, it's mostly for the occasional online shopping, but even then, I mostly use my phone unless it’s for bigger purchases like flights.\n\nI’m thinking of maybe taking some online courses in data/stat analysis down the line through DataCamp, so I’d like to keep something around \"just in case.\" But with my usage dropping, a work laptop at hand, and my own M1 iPad Pro, I’ve been considering a trade-in for something that fits my needs better:\n\n- New M4 Mini: Smaller footprint but still something I could keep on my desk.\n\n- 13-inch MacBook Air: Either wait for the M4 or go with the M3.  The current 16-inch MacBook Pro I have is a bit big for me now.\n\n- M4 iPad Pro: Trading in my M1 iPad Pro and MacBook for it and going all-in. This would be my main device besides my phone, and it can handle everything I need. I also use my iPad for work notes during meetings, streaming on the go, and as my travel “computer” when I visit family. However, when I think of this option it feels weird to me not having some sort of laptop/computer that's not a tablet.\n\nI would appreciate any advice as I have been going back and forth on this recently.",

        "content": "(Note: Apologies for the formatting, I am on mobile.)\n\nHey all, my dad asked me a few weeks ago to look into investing for him. My dad is 63, debt free, owns several rental properties, a few HYSAs (cash totaling ~400k) and is wanting to invest about 50-75k if possible (we will likely start out smaller though).\n\nThe thing is, my dad is an immigrant who did not go to high school or college & does not speak a lot of English so a lot of these finance things (such as HYSA, Roth IRA, etc) he did not know about until way later in his life and there are not as many good resources on investing in Spanish (especially US-specific advice) as there are in English.\n\nAdmittedly, I’m not well versed in investing at all (22F, I went to business school in university, but unless you’re a finance major, everything was kind of brushed over). My dad has never contributed to his Roth IRA (I know, I know) so I was thinking of maxing that out first and then doing the rest in a brokerage. I tried to do research from lots of different sources and here is an asset allocation I came up with, please let me know your thoughts:\n\n\nEquities (Index Funds & ETFS): 60%\n- For about 45%, I’d probably do a mixture of VOO, FXAIX, and FSKAX. Generally stable and have some growth potential\n- For the remaining 15%, I was thinking something like QQQ. A little more volatile hence why I’m allocating a lower percentage but stronger growth potential\n\nBonds (ETFs or Short Term Bonds): 40%\n- For about 25%, I was thinking of doing a total bond market ETF (such as BND) to balance out equity market risks\n- For about 15%, I was thinking Short Term Bonds like VGSH or SHY. More liquid and adding more stability to make the portfolio less sensitive to rate changes\n\n\nIs this optimal? Or should I do a different allocation in the Roth IRA? Another option I was thinking possibly to also do purely Equities in the Roth IRA since it has tax advantages, and the allocation above for the remaining amount in the brokerage account. \n\nSo that’s what I was able to gather keeping my dad’s age in mind. My dad’s goal isn’t necessarily to make crazy insane gains, mostly just to keep more of his money moving and get a decent ROI, preferably better than his HYSAs. My brother tried him on Crypto in 2021 (thankfully only about $1k invested) and he lost about 1/3 of his investment after 3 years so I really don’t wanna fuck this up for him. I wish I learned more about investing sooner (and I’m still learning by the day), but it all just seemed like so much to wrap my head around with a big learning curve, so it intimidated me and I didn’t know where to look back then. \n\nLet me know your thoughts on the asset allocation and thanks for reading til here! \n",

Always believed that only people that have a fortune can make money, and only lived his life in the present moment, never has been actually able to provide for his family - his wife is the one having a stable income, an currently only income (around 2000 euros, much less then what they would need, based on the lifestyle that they try having). They always owe money to somebody and have always been in debt. \n\nLong story short, he keeps “investing” time and money into it, he is always “very close” to actually be profitable, but as time goes by, we only keep hearing that something unexpected happened, that his strategy still needs a little improvement, that he is not in the right mindset yet, etc. \n\nHe already spent all his family’s savings + much more buying founded accounts, he does not work, neither want to do anything else and his wife and one of his daughters keep supporting him - his wife, because she does believe in miracles (type of woman that buys 300 tablets that make you lose 50 kg of fat in 2 weeks) and his daughter because she thinks that he is very smart and will eventually make it. \n\n\nWe are now heading for year 5 of his addiction. He does not stop, not even when we go out for dinner, sit at the table and talk, etc. he is always with his phone in his hand, checking that fucking graph and putting buy/sell orders every 10 minutes. None of his family members seem to care about it or at least do not understand the gravity of the situation. I am trying to explain this to my wife as she seems to be the only one that can stop him or at least try to, but she does not know how to start the conversation either, so if anyone has any suggestions or has gone through something similar, I would really appreciate any suggestion..",

The tech-heavy index popped 0.78% to close at a record 18,713, while the S&P 500 nudged up 0.16%. Over on the Dow, it was a different story—sticking to its more cautious pace as all eyes shifted to big tech.\n* Alphabet kicked things off by beating Wall Street’s expectations after hours, setting the tone for the rest of the week. With Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple set to report soon, the pressure’s on for these giants to keep the momentum rolling.\n\n# \n\n# Winners & Losers\n\n# What’s up 📈\n\n* **VF Corporation** surged 27.01% after its fiscal Q2 earnings beat expectations, posting 60 cents per share on $2.76 billion in revenue, surpassing the forecasted 37 cents per share and $2.71 billion. ($VFC)\n* **Welltower** rose 5.23% as it reported Q3 revenue of $2.06 billion, a 23.7% increase from the same period last year, with EPS jumping to $1.11 from $0.24 year-over-year. ($WELL)\n* **Waste Management** climbed 5.21% with an 8% revenue growth in Q3, while EBITDA rose 11% and cash from operations increased 16% over the first three quarters of 2024 compared to 2023. ($WM)\n* **Broadcom** increased 4.20% following reports that OpenAI is collaborating with TSMC and Broadcom to develop an in-house AI chip, and is now using AMD chips alongside Nvidia's for AI training. ($AVGO)\n* **AMD** ticked up 3.96% on news of OpenAI's partnership with TSMC and Broadcom to build an in-house AI chip, with AMD chips joining Nvidia's for AI model training. ($AMD)\n* **CrowdStrike** rose 3.19%. ($CRWD)\n\n# What’s down 📉\n\n* **Crocs** dropped 19.17% after its Q4 outlook missed analysts' expectations, forecasting adjusted earnings of $2.20 to $2.28 per share compared to the anticipated $2.72. ($CROX)\n* **Ford** fell 8.44% as it guided to the lower end of its 2024 earnings outlook, despite beating Q3 revenue and earnings forecasts. ($F)\n* **D.R. Horton** slipped 7.24% after reporting earnings of $3.92 per share on $10.0 billion in revenue, missing estimates of $4.17 per share and $10.22 billion in revenue. The company cited rate volatility as a factor affecting buyer activity. ($DHI)\n* **SoFi Technologies** declined 6.43% despite reporting record Q3 earnings and raising guidance, with CEO Anthony Noto calling it the company's \"strongest quarter in our history.\" ($SOFI)\n* **NextEra Energy** dipped 3.99% after announcing plans to raise $1.5 billion through an equity unit offering to fund new projects. ($NEE)\n* **PayPal** slipped 3.96% after giving softer-than-expected Q4 guidance, forecasting \"low single-digit growth\" despite exceeding Q3 earnings expectations but missing slightly on revenue. ($PYPL)\n\n# \n\n# Alphabet Shares Rise On Earnings Beat Boosted by Cloud Revenue\n\nAlphabet’s Q3 results just hit, and the tech giant exceeded Wall Street’s expectations thanks to—you guessed it—Google Cloud. \n\nRevenue clocked in at $88.3 billion, topping estimates, with Google Cloud alone raking in $11.35 billion, up nearly 35% from last year. CEO Sundar Pichai credits their “full-stack” AI, which is pulling in enterprise clients and making big gains against cloud behemoths like Amazon and Microsoft.\n\nBut it wasn’t all rosy. Google’s ad machine, its core revenue driver, is showing its age. Search pulled in $49.4 billion, and YouTube added another $8.9 billion, though both grew slower than last quarter. \n\nThe ad market is a bit crowded these days, with TikTok, Amazon, and Netflix all vying for screen time and ad dollars, putting the squeeze on Alphabet’s ad growth.\n\n**AI as Cost Cutter**  \n  \nWith new CFO Anat Ashkenazi at the helm, Alphabet is taking a hard look at costs. She highlighted AI-powered efficiencies and “strategic” workforce adjustments, while also doubling down on data centers to power their expanding AI ambitions. These cost-focused moves aren’t just about trimming the fat—they’re about setting up for long-term AI-driven growth.\n\nInvestors liked what they saw, pushing Alphabet shares up 5.82% in after-hours trading. \n\nAnd as the rest of Big Tech gears up to report this week, Alphabet’s strong Q3 may set the pace, underscoring that in today’s market, AI might just be the ticket to the top.\n\n# \n\n# Market Movements\n\n* **🍏 Apple’s Jam-Packed Week of Announcements:** Apple kicked off a busy week, unveiling the new Apple Intelligence for iPhone 15 and newer models, featuring an upgraded Siri and notification summaries. Later in the week, Apple will launch a new iMac and MacBook Pro with M4 chips, along with a host of accessory upgrades.\n* **🚗 Waymo Raises $5.6B for Autonomous Expansion:** Alphabet’s autonomous vehicle arm, Waymo, completed its largest funding round to date, raising $5.6B. With 100,000 weekly robotaxi rides across cities like San Francisco, Phoenix, and LA, Waymo aims to expand its fleet and services further. ($GOOGL)\n* **🏢 Office Loan Stress Hits U.S. Regional Banks:** KeyCorp and Fifth Third Bancorp are grappling with rising non-performing loans in their commercial real estate portfolios, particularly in office space, as remote work dampens demand. Analysts warn of further strain as a $950B \"maturity wall\" looms. ($KEY), ($FITB)\n* **🦃 Target Offers Budget Thanksgiving Meal Deals:** Target has lowered its Thanksgiving meal bundle to $20, covering a frozen turkey and sides. This move joins other grocers like Aldi and Walmart in making Thanksgiving affordable, as grocery inflation slows to 1.3% for September. ($TGT)\n* **🛢️ Oil Prices Drop After Israel’s Strike on Iran:** Oil prices saw a sharp decline following Israel’s missile strike on Iran, which notably spared the country’s oil production, alleviating fears of supply disruption.\n* **🚗 Volkswagen Plans Mass Layoffs in Germany:** Volkswagen faces backlash after revealing plans for extensive layoffs and plant closures in Germany, impacting thousands of workers. Employee protests have begun, and labor leaders warn of strikes if negotiations aren’t settled by December.\n* **📉 Boeing Sells Stock to Avoid Junk Status:** Boeing announced a $19 billion stock sale to boost cash flowamid ongoing machinist strikes and credit concerns. Fitch Ratings has threatened to downgrade Boeing to junk if the strike persists, with pension disputes fueling the conflict.\n\n# \n\n# Echelon Of Earnings\n\n* 🍔 **McDonald’s** missed Wall Street expectations in Q3 as international sales struggled, with same-store sales dropping 1.5%—a worse hit than analysts had anticipated. The U.S. market offered a small lift with a 0.3% increase, aided by a popular $5 meal deal that resonated with lower-income consumers. Shares slipped 0.6% as investors eyed the potential impact of the recent E. coli outbreak affecting 20% of U.S. locations. Adjusted EPS came in at $3.23 ($MCD). \n* 🚗 **Ford’s** stock tumbled 8.44% after revising its 2024 outlook to the lower end of its profit range ($10 billion vs. up to $12 billion initially projected). High warranty costs and scaling back EV spending amid sluggish demand weighed on results, though Q3 earnings still beat expectations at $0.49 EPS on $43.07 billion in automotive revenue. Execs highlighted gains in its Ford Pro division but noted ongoing struggles to contain costs ($F). \n* 💳 **PayPal** fell 3.96% after issuing a revenue forecast for Q4 that undercut analyst estimates, citing a “price-to-value strategy” that may slow growth. While Q3 revenue of $7.85 billion came up slightly short, payment volume grew 9% to $422.6 billion. EPS rose 6% to $0.99, with the company focusing on enhancing checkout features and digital currencies to boost engagement ($PYPL). \n* 👟 **Crocs** plunged 19.17% after trimming its full-year sales growth outlook to 3% and forecasting a steep 15% decline in its HeyDude brand sales, as opposed to the prior 8%-10% dip expected. Crocs’ overall Q3 revenue rose 1.6% to $1.06 billion, though concerns over slower HeyDude performance and school bans on Crocs shoes kept investor sentiment down ($CROX). \n* 🔋 **AMD** slipped 7.64% in after-hours after its Q4 revenue forecast of $7.5 billion missed Wall Street’s target, dampening hopes for rapid growth in its AI chip business. Q3 saw an 18% jump in revenue to $6.82 billion and EPS in line with forecasts at $0.92, yet some investors worry AMD’s AI ambitions are lagging Nvidia’s. AI-related demand from data centers bolstered performance, but slowing gaming chip sales put a drag on results ($AMD). \n* 👻 **Snap** rebounded 7.07% after initially dropping on mixed Q3 results, with revenue climbing 15% to $1.37 billion, just ahead of expectations. Snapchat’s daily active users rose 9% to 443 million, driven by increased video engagement, though Q4 guidance came in soft as upper-funnel ad spending from large clients faltered. Snap approved a $500 million buyback as part of efforts to boost shareholder value ($SNAP). \n* 📈 **Reddit** soared 21.65% in after-hours trading as its Q3 sales and holiday-quarter forecast surpassed analyst expectations. Revenue for Q3 came in at $348.4 million, easily topping the $312.8 million consensus, and marked Reddit’s first profitable quarter since its IPO in March. The platform’s shares have nearly tripled from their debut price, a boost attributed to strong ad tech investments. For the holiday season, Reddit projects revenue between $385 million and $400 million, above the $356 million Wall Street forecasted ($RDDT).\n\n# \n\n# On The Horizon\n\n# Tomorrow\n\nSeptember’s ADP report showed a strong boost in private sector jobs, with 143,000 positions added. If October’s numbers follow suit, the Fed might be smiling, knowing the labor market is still holding up amid their rate hikes.\n\nTomorrow, we get the first look at Q3 GDP, though it’s just the initial slice in a three-month data cake. Not the most precise reading, but still a useful clue for assessing the pulse of the U.S. economy.\n\nAnd for earnings-watchers, two of the “Magnificent 7” stocks drop their results tomorrow, along with a heavyweight in Big Pharma and a legend in the condiment game.\n\n# Before Market Open: \n\n* **Eli Lilly** is making waves as one of the top dogs in the weight-loss drug game, thanks to blockbuster meds like Mounjaro and Zepbound. But heads up—new GLP-1 contenders are popping up faster than you can say “pharma boom.” Luckily, Lilly’s broader pipeline is looking solid, and with profits soaring, they’ve got the cash flow to keep pouring into R&D. Analysts are betting on $4.49 EPS with $12.21 billion in revenue ($LLY).\n\n# After Market Close: \n\n* **Microsoft**’s partnership with OpenAI should have it dominating the AI race, and while it’s a clear leader in the field, the stock’s been sluggish. Investors are eyeing ongoing boardroom drama at OpenAI, ballooning costs, and a lukewarm reception to Microsoft’s AI products. Still, Microsoft’s pouring billions into AI infrastructure, and shareholders are hoping that investment won’t be a money pit. Consensus: $3.10 EPS, $64.48 billion in revenue ($MSFT). \n* **Meta Platforms**, meanwhile, has shifted focus from the metaverse flop to an AI-heavy strategy. Over the past 18 months, Meta has laid off tens of thousands to boost efficiency, funneled funds into smart glasses, and built up Threads. But its bread and butter? Ads. With election season fueling political ad revenue, investors are eager to see Zuckerberg’s plans for reinvesting those profits. Consensus: $5.21 EPS, $40.13 billion in revenue ($META).",

        "content": "**Oil**\n\nCLZ4 continues looking bearing given the Israel/Iran news. If we manage to hold above 67 and break above $68.40 start looking into long. So far seems like the next target is around $64.\n\n[CLZ4 1h and 5 mins](https://preview.redd.it/yj45482p7rxd1.png?width=2559&format=png&auto=webp&s=ad38a990e3fc9cb54bbaf0e318fb60a4323269c0)\n\n**Gold**\n\nToday we have seen another all-time high in GCZ4. Regardless of the $2764-2767 resistance level, where the price spent some price during the premarket, the US session was bullish, looking into the continuation for the upside. \n\n[GCZ4 1h and 5 mins](https://preview.redd.it/es5e18gl8rxd1.png?width=2559&format=png&auto=webp&s=27e306a9da3cc54838d85b31fe0644dff0c7cb20)\n\n**S&P500**\n\nESZ4 is stalling before big earnings are released. Later today, Alphabet, AMD, and Visa will report their quarterly results. Tomorrow, after the market closes, we will see the results of Microsoft and Meta. Amazon, Apple, and Intel will report on Thursday after the US session is closed. I'd expect extremely volatile days, and maybe just watch the price action from the side. \n\n[ESZ4 1h and 5 mins](https://preview.redd.it/gdj788x99rxd1.png?width=2559&format=png&auto=webp&s=c8d83a66ea966304ecacb4b344623610b1ea9d6b)\n\n**Bitcoin**\n\nDigital gold tickling all-time highs around $72000 on a spot market. Futures are priced slightly higher. The question is will the momentum continue and all short-sellers will be squeezed out, or HF hedge funds will be pushing the price lower? As of right now, I'll be watching BTCX4 inside the area of $72130-72310 to make my decision.\n\n[BTCX4 1h and 5 mins](https://preview.redd.it/iciy1ypqbrxd1.png?width=2557&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a44cb8ecc7da9cd6ddcfe2f07b978ac2229fb71)\n\n**EUR/USD**\n\n6EZ4 continues to try the upside movement. The publication of a Redbook and the US consumer confidence acted as catalysts to push the price to the resistance area of 1.08360-1.08385, Given the volume inflow it seems that we should be looking into targets of 1.08625 and above.\n\n[6EZ4 1h and 5 mins](https://preview.redd.it/air4fwtxarxd1.png?width=2557&format=png&auto=webp&s=38b65e51822e83da798f2b24acc19eac3dedcc7a)\n\n**GBP/USD**\n\nThe UK pound gaining momentum with its upward movement. The demand zone around 1.2943-1.2956 was defended by buyers, later followed up with extra volume during the breakout of the 1.3000 level. There is a solid chance of upward continuation. \n\n[6BZ4 1h and 5 min](https://preview.redd.it/25jpnldxcrxd1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f0c2493c4e4bf7c24f48a9749963ed29e805f42)\n\n**JPY/USD**\n\nJapanese Yen trying to stabilize after the Monday drop. 6JZ4 contract confirmed the demand zone at the price range between $0.006540-$0.006542. The volume stayed relatively average. Tomorrow at 1 am NY time Japan will release consumer confidence data. I would wait for another $0.006541 touch before making any decision about the direction. \n\n[6JZ4 1h and 5 mins](https://preview.redd.it/2390axwgerxd1.png?width=2558&format=png&auto=webp&s=283a7bb0d4b2434d034987931d49d1778446c942)\n\n\n\nWhat are your thoughts?

        "content": "* Stocks kicked off a high-stakes earnings week on a positive note, with the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones all rising Monday. Leading the pack, the Dow gained nearly 0.7%, or 273 points, as investors bet on tech giants meeting sky-high expectations. Cooling crude prices helped the mood, with markets easing up as recent Middle East tensions showed signs of stabilization.\n* The week’s lineup is packed with heavyweight reports—Alphabet drops results on Tuesday, followed by Microsoft and Meta on Wednesday, and Apple and Amazon closing it out Thursday. Traders are counting on these tech titans to keep the Nasdaq climbing as the broader market looks for solid footing amid the latest earnings and economic updates.\n\n# Winners & Losers\n\n# What’s up 📈\n\n* **NIO Inc.** increased 10.46% after Macquarie upgraded the Chinese EV maker to \"outperform\" from \"neutral,\" citing strong Q4 Onvo L60 orders expected to drive volume growth. ($NIO)\n* **Carnival Corp.** rose 4.83% as lower oil prices provided a boost, reducing fuel costs for the cruise line. ($CCL)\n* **3M** ticked up 4.44% after JPMorgan raised the price target to $165 from $160, maintaining an Overweight rating. ($MMM)\n* **Robinhood** increased 3.03% after announcing the launch of election-based contracts, available to eligible U.S. users. ($HOOD)\n\n# What’s down 📉\n\n* **Philips** dropped 15.95% after the Dutch health-care devices company lowered its revenue outlook for 2024, citing weaker demand from Chinese hospitals and consumers, according to CEO Roy Jakobs. ($PHG)\n* **ADT** declined 6.47% following the announcement of its secondary public offering pricing and a concurrent share repurchase. ($ADT)\n* **Dropbox** fell 3.27%. ($DBX)\n* **Bath & Body Works** slipped 3.06%. ($BBWI)\n\n# \n\n# iOS 18.1 Is Here: Apple Intelligence, New Siri Look, AirPod Hearing Aids and More\n\n  \niOS 18.1 just dropped, and while the number’s small, the update’s big. \n\nApple Intelligence has finally entered the chat for iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 16 users, adding AI-driven features that make handling notifications, cleaning up photos, and rewriting text easier. Siri even got a facelift—she’s glowing around the edges now, though her brains might still need a boost.\n\nIt’s the start of Apple’s slow-and-steady approach to AI, with bigger updates like ChatGPT integration coming in December.\n\n**Siri Glow-Up & AirPods Hearing Boost**  \n  \nIf you’re an AirPods Pro 2 user, you can now take a clinical-grade hearing test and turn those earbuds into custom hearing aids—because who knew AirPods could get even more versatile? \n\nMeanwhile, Siri’s makeover adds a sleek new look and lets you text questions, perfect for keeping things low-key in public. But heads up, many of the coolest Apple Intelligence features, like custom emojis, are set for the iOS 18.2 drop next month.\n\n**Notifications & Photos, Reimagined**  \n  \nSick of endless notifications? Apple Intelligence now packs alerts into one tidy message, cutting down the noise. The Photos app also got a cleanup button—just tap to make photobombers vanish. \n\nThese updates keep Apple’s promise of a user-first approach to AI, with more fun features rolling out in waves. It’s clear they’re aiming for smart, streamlined interactions rather than an AI free-for-all.\n\n**What’s Coming Next?**  \n  \nApple’s playing it cool in the AI race, but the foundation is set. Expect major upgrades in iOS 18.2, from ChatGPT tools to a smarter Siri that may finally become as helpful as it looks.\n\nUntil then, iOS 18.1 offers a taste of Apple’s AI future, blending usability with privacy.\n\n# \n\n# Market Movements\n\n* **💵 JPMorgan Takes Action on Viral ATM \"Money Glitch\":** JPMorgan Chase is suing multiple customers for allegedly exploiting an ATM glitch that let them withdraw funds before checks bounced. In one Houston case, a defendant owes $290,939 after a fake $335,000 check was deposited and funds withdrawn immediately. The bank has closed the loophole and is pursuing repayments, interest, and punitive damages in federal courts across the country. ($JPM)\n* **📉 Ford Adjusts Earnings Forecast Amid Cost Pressures:** Ford reported third-quarter results with adjusted earnings slightly surpassing Wall Street's estimates but guided to the lower end of its 2024 forecast, citing inflation and warranty costs. The automaker achieved its goal of $2B in cost cuts but saw these gains offset by rising expenses. Shares fell over 4% in after-hours trading. ($F)\n* **💼 Delta Takes CrowdStrike to Court:** Delta is suing CrowdStrike for over $500M, blaming a faulty July software update for flight disruptions impacting 1.3 million travelers, though CrowdStrike argues Delta’s outdated systems share the fault. ($DAL), ($CRWD).\n* **🍔 Quarter Pounders Return at McDonald's – Hold the Onions:** McDonald's plans to reintroduce its Quarter Pounders after clearing beef patties of an E. coli link, though raw onions, suspected in the contamination, won’t be back at 900 locations. ($MCD).\n* **🔍 Huawei Chip Discovery Stalls TSMC Shipments:** TSMC has halted shipments to Sophgo after spotting its chips in a Huawei processor, raising concerns over U.S. export rules. Sophgo denies links with Huawei. ($TSM).\n* **💰 Boeing Eyes $15B Stock Sale for Cash Boost:** Boeing is preparing a $15B stock and preferred share saleto shore up finances after a series of production halts and recent financial losses. ($BA).\n* **📱 Apple Awarded Damages in Masimo Watch Case:** A jury awarded Apple $250M, finding Masimo’s smartwatches infringed on design patents, though Apple failed to secure a sales ban. ($AAPL)\n\n# \n\n# Robinhood Jumps Into Election Trading, Giving Users Chance To Buy Harris Or Trump contracts\n\n  \nRobinhood just tossed its hat into the election betting ring, letting users wager on the 2024 presidential showdown. \n\nStarting today, users can buy contracts on either Kamala Harris or Donald Trump taking the White House, adding a new spin to the world of retail investing. The catch? Contracts fluctuate based on demand, with buyers scoring $1 per win, and users must meet a few eligibility requirements before diving in.\n\n**Playing the Odds in a Tight Race**  \n  \nWhy now? A recent court ruling gave U.S. platforms like Kalshi the green light to offer election markets, opening a whole new betting frontier. Robinhood’s take?\n\nIt’s “democratizing access” to real-time events—a statement that’s got more than a few people scratching their heads. Yet, with the race heating up, the idea of betting on democracy is sparking serious interest, even if it’s only for the presidency for now.\n\n**Betting Markets Get a Twist**  \n  \nWhile traditional polls are crunching numbers, these betting markets take a different path—odds can swing wildly, with factors like big spenders tilting results. \n\nCase in point: a recent betting blitz on Trump by a single French bettor shifted his odds on Polymarket. So, while polls might say one thing, betting markets can tell a different, albeit skewed, story.\n\n**More to Come?**  \n  \nWith this new election feature, Robinhood is testing the waters. If it clicks with users, don’t be surprised if event-based betting options become a regular menu item. For now, \n\nRobinhood’s dipping its toes into a whole new category, giving retail investors a front-row seat in one of the year’s most-watched contests.\n\n# \n\n# On The Horizon\n\n# Tomorrow\n\nAs earnings season cranks up, we’re doubling the forecast fun and keeping the economic scoop to the essentials.\n\nOctober Consumer Confidence: Labor market jitters knocked confidence down a peg last month. But with the holiday cheer around the corner, analysts are holding out for a boost.\n\nSeptember Job Openings: Flatlined job openings last month might sound boring, but with Wall Street watching labor like hawks, it was surprisingly welcome news.\n\nAugust S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index: It’s been a relentless 14-month climb for home prices, with new records month after month. Analysts are crossing fingers that softer interest rates might finally cool things down.\n\n# Before Market Open:\n\n* **McDonald’s** was already having a rough year, and then E. coli hit. While a bacteria outbreak isn’t exactly on-brand for a burger giant, for McDonald's, it’s more of a speed bump than a full stop. The real worry for investors? Sluggish sales, value meal margins, and a future where weight-loss drugs might curb fast-food cravings. Consensus: $3.19 EPS, $6.79 billion in revenue. ($MCD)\n* **Crocs** may not be the first thing you think of when it comes to growth stocks, but the famously unfashionable clog brand is on fire. Stellar margins, rocketing sales, and a strong brand have powered shares up nearly 300% over five years. Wall Street’s in love: 11 of 12 analysts say \"buy,\" with an average price target 25% above today’s price. Consensus: $3.10 EPS, $1.05 billion in revenue. ($CROX)\n\n# After Market Close:\n\n* **Snap Inc.** might be the forgotten sibling in social media, but it’s not down for the count. Shares have dropped over 35% this year, tanking further after last quarter’s grim revenue guidance. Still, its focus on AI and AR could set it apart, especially if a TikTok ban were to drive U.S. users back to Snap. Consensus: $0.05 EPS, $1.36 billion in revenue. ($SNAP)\n* **Advanced Micro Devices** has a front-row seat in the AI play, navigating the ups and downs of chip demand. It’s no Nvidia, which has been riding high all year, or ASML, which has seen rough patches, but AMD’s diversified model could give it a smoother ride. If AMD slips, though, cue the pundits declaring the AI hype over. Consensus: $0.91 EPS, $6.71 billion in revenue. ($AMD)",
