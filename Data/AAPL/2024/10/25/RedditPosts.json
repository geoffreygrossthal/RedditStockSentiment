When it comes to huge companies, like Amazon, Nvidia and others, it's obvious you can and should keep their stocks when they give you significant profits, say, 11% in a month (unless there is something obvious that could crumble them ofc). \n\nBut what about smaller companies that ppl find full of potential? I bought Celestica Inc. (CLS) stocks like a month ago. It's already given me about 15% (after yesterday's strong earnings report). I read articles where this company is stated promising etc, but I'd like to know when it is the best time to sell. \n\nIt may rise even more which could lead to a lost profit for me, but what's the common strategy in such cases?",

You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.",

        "content": "Back in April I signed up for Sharesight. At first I was happy. I did everything manually. I also write a lot of options contracts. I established makeshift transactions using a CASH and PROFIT position to log them, adding premiums to the PROFIT and when assigned purchasing shares in the given security at my strike price. Everything seemed to be working. \n\nUntil I realized my returns were being diluted after every infusion of capital into my portfolio. The whole damn point of tracking software is to assess my time-/capital-weighted--i.e. ACTUAL--returns. Instead, just like Schwab or any other brokerage that costs me nothing to use, if I doubled a position in which I'd earned a 20% return, suddenly it would be diluted to 10%. \n\nAs any fund manager or investor worth their weight in salt understands, my performance isn't cut in half simply because I double my position size. Any software worth $200/year should, at the very least, have this figured out. It's utterly bemusing to me that Sharesight's engineers spent all this time fussing with incredibly detailed tools and yet didn't stop to think of this issue. \n\nIt took me months to realize the problem because I've been performing very well this year, and my biweekly capital infusions after receiving my paycheck were small enough to fly under the radar. Each infusion knocked my performance down a few basis points that were largely covered up by strong performance. \n\nBut then I sold my business, with the express intention of investing the majority of the proceeds in the market. Once I started injecting relatively large sums into my account, I saw my total \"return\" drop dramatically in kind. \n\nIt's just beyond my capacity to understand why a software that advertises itself as a performance tracker would quite literally fail one of the most basic functions. It completely defeats the purpose. I wasted my money, and I will be cancelling my Sharesight subscription when my year comes up. \n\nNow I need some advice. Is there any tracker that actually works as it's supposed to? As explained, I'm more than happy to manually input my trades. But I need something that actually tracks my performance. I'm not going to stop adding capital to my portfolio, so the problem needs to be solved at the root. Otherwise I might as well do the entire thing on my own. ",

        "content": "Hoping somebody here has some suggestions on how to get back to my old operating speed. Apologies in advance for the long post, just trying to include all the details and what I've done so far....\n\niMac is 2017  (Model iMac18,3)  \n27\" 5K Retina  \n3.8 GHz Quad Core Intel Core i5  \n24GB RAM  \n2.12TB Fusion drive (1.2 TB free)  \nVentura 13.7\n\nLiterally overnight my mac has become unusably slow. Last Sat it was working fine, on Sun it was crawling. It was taking several minutes to respond to anything (even moving/minimising windows), showing no back ground picture, not loading anything (at least I didn't wait long enough, I gave up after about an hour).\n\nI rebooted, same behaviour. Booting took ages. Over 15 minutes (again, I just left it and did other stuff, so no exact time). Eventually manged to open Activity Monitor, showed less than 10% CPU usage, 7GB or less of RAM usage. Edit to add: systems would sit for a while, going slow, then reboot itself.\n\nBooted in Recovery (cmd+option+R), ran first aid on the drives, it did report an issue with the HDD portion, but said I needed to run first aid from within recovery. I was in Recovery (internet loaded one I'm pretty sure).\n\nSafe boot wasn't any faster.\n\nI ended up wiping and formatting the drives (i.e. both bits of the fusion drive), then had to re-fusion them (otherwise resoring from time machine didn't want to work, not enough space on the 128GB SSD). Fresh install of Ventura, restored from time machine backup.\n\nStill very slow, but slightly improved. Takes several minutes to boot up, where it used to take less than a minute. Opening a program is painfully slow, can't play a video in quicktime at all. I can move windows and minimise them instantly, but anything that seems to require thinking about just doesn't happen, or does slow very slowly (still low CPU and RAM usage)\n\nSMART drive monitor details don't show any issues.\n\nCurrently, after mucking about with it for ages, it takes just over a minute to get to the login screen. Then 2 minutes of spinning circle before it prompts for password for a 2nd time, then another 2 minutes before my desktop starts to load (sidebar only, no icons/menu etc.), icons there another 30 seconds later, menu bar a bit after that.\n\nI'm guessing the spinny HDD bit of the fusion drive is showing it's age?  \nBest to upgrade to an SSD?\n\nAny other idea for what may be causing the slow down?\n\nI've seen the instructions for putting in an internal SSD, which don't scare me too much (I'm and electronics engineer, just not on computers), but also using an external USB C SSD drive looks cheaper, easier and less likely to break something.\n\nIs there any advantage to going the internal method?\n\nEdited for spolling miskates\n\n  \nUPDATE edit: See message below. It was the fusion drive, replaced it with a 2TB M.2 SSD in a Thunderbolt enclosure and all is good. Thanks all!",

        "content": "So I've got a 2015 27\" iMac that I absolutely love - but alas 'tis no longer supported and will need to upgraded.  I do believe I've settled on moving away from the all in one iMac approach, replacing it with a MacMini + various components (monitor, external storage, etc).\n\nAs I think through some implications (it's been a minute since I've replaced my desktop...) - as I go from a 2TB iMac to a MacMini that has far less on-board storage - In a scenario where I add incremental storage via multiple external hard drives (I'm thinking of using two 2TB external SSD's - one to run applications/store information, and one as a backup drive) - how do I best manage a migration?  When 2015 iMac was bought, there was a handy migration manager that simply moved data from whatever my older model was to the 2015 model - and as 2015 model has enough on-board storage - it wasn't a problem.\n\nHow do I think about what that looks like today?  Does the modern migration manager (or whatever it's called - the utility that allows you to seamlessly move your profile/data from the old thing to the new thing) - allow for migrating that data from a single, large capacity hard drive to multiple, smaller hard drives?\n\nHow do I best think about this?  \nThank you!",

        "content": "First, sorry for the extremely crappy iPhone video… tried capturing the issue on screen in mirror mode as well as extended but for some reason it wouldn’t show. You can basically get the gist by watching the cursor.\n\nIssue: Have a ViewSonic VX3276-4K-MHD 32 Inch 4K UHD Monitor that I am testing as an external monitor with an M1 Max Powerbook running Monterey 12.6.9. I’m getting what I can only describe as ghosting when moving windows, the cursor, scrolling websites… etc. I’ve tried connecting the monitor to the Mac with an HDMI to Thunderbolt cable inserted on the right side of the Mac by the HDMI port. I also tried both thunderbolt ports on the left side. I’ve tried 2 different HDMI to HDMI cables connected to the HDMI port on the Mac with the same results. I actually have 2 of these ViewSonic VX3276-4K monitors. When I connect to the other one with the HDMI to Thunderbolt there is no issue on the second monitor.\n\nBoth monitors are connected to a 2010 5,1 Mac Pro desktop with an AMD Radeon RX 5600 XT… I’m using the DisplayPort on one to connect to the graphics card and the HDMI on the other. When testing the problem monitor I was manually switching between the 5,1 and M1 Max via the onboard monitor menu. I also did try and pull the DisplayPort cable connected to the 5,1 to see if that made a difference… it didn’t.\n\nOther things tried, adjusting brightness, switching refresh rate and switching resolution via BetterDisplay app.\n\nI’m at a loss as why one monitor would connect fine and the other wouldn’t. I would appreciate any input.\n\nTLDR: Ghosting on Viewsonic monitor connected to an M1 Max 16” Powerbook running Monterey 12.6.9\n",
