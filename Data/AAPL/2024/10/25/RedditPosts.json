The first rounds of filtering were based on the overall trend of revenue growth over 20, 10, & 5 years. All must be positive\n\n2. The second round is based on the actual current size of revenue & total equity growth. Generally it must be at least +30% rev & eq combined\n\n3. Third round, consistency. Any \"weird\" financials, inconsistencies are tossed\n\n4. Soft fourth for value, taking into account PEG and other price:financial metrics\n\n5. Fifth leaves us with around 50.

When it comes to huge companies, like Amazon, Nvidia and others, it's obvious you can and should keep their stocks when they give you significant profits, say, 11% in a month (unless there is something obvious that could crumble them ofc). \n\nBut what about smaller companies that ppl find full of potential? I bought Celestica Inc. (CLS) stocks like a month ago. It's already given me about 15% (after yesterday's strong earnings report). I read articles where this company is stated promising etc, but I'd like to know when it is the best time to sell. \n\nIt may rise even more which could lead to a lost profit for me, but what's the common strategy in such cases?",

You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.",

        "content": "Back in April I signed up for Sharesight. At first I was happy. I did everything manually. I also write a lot of options contracts. I established makeshift transactions using a CASH and PROFIT position to log them, adding premiums to the PROFIT and when assigned purchasing shares in the given security at my strike price. Everything seemed to be working. \n\nUntil I realized my returns were being diluted after every infusion of capital into my portfolio. The whole damn point of tracking software is to assess my time-/capital-weighted--i.e. ACTUAL--returns. Instead, just like Schwab or any other brokerage that costs me nothing to use, if I doubled a position in which I'd earned a 20% return, suddenly it would be diluted to 10%. \n\nAs any fund manager or investor worth their weight in salt understands, my performance isn't cut in half simply because I double my position size. Any software worth $200/year should, at the very least, have this figured out. It's utterly bemusing to me that Sharesight's engineers spent all this time fussing with incredibly detailed tools and yet didn't stop to think of this issue. \n\nIt took me months to realize the problem because I've been performing very well this year, and my biweekly capital infusions after receiving my paycheck were small enough to fly under the radar. Each infusion knocked my performance down a few basis points that were largely covered up by strong performance. \n\nBut then I sold my business, with the express intention of investing the majority of the proceeds in the market. Once I started injecting relatively large sums into my account, I saw my total \"return\" drop dramatically in kind. \n\nIt's just beyond my capacity to understand why a software that advertises itself as a performance tracker would quite literally fail one of the most basic functions. It completely defeats the purpose. I wasted my money, and I will be cancelling my Sharesight subscription when my year comes up. \n\nNow I need some advice. Is there any tracker that actually works as it's supposed to? As explained, I'm more than happy to manually input my trades. But I need something that actually tracks my performance. I'm not going to stop adding capital to my portfolio, so the problem needs to be solved at the root. Otherwise I might as well do the entire thing on my own. ",
