Still, you gotta take a moment to contemplate this.\n\nThe funny thing is that Elon has outright lied/being wrong with predictions like dates for models and stuff, most recently the shenanigans with the robot at his events.\n\n\nBUT 2 weeks later he says 20-30 revenue growth next year and everyone believes him lol.\n\n\nThanks god im not a bear",

You probably wouldn’t accept the same risk at 20 than at 60, especially if your stock portfolio is part of your retirement plan.\n\nI agree with a value investing philosophy, so to me never selling implies the original investment thesis doesn’t change. \n\nI think we could have an interesting discussion if we share our age (or age range) and the company in which we trust for the rest of our lives (and why).\n\nI’m in my 30s, so assuming I live for the next 50 years, I believe Lockheed Martin ($LMT) will remain an important player in the defense sector, as I expect war (mostly proxy wars) to continue being used for political interests and if the US DoD sees its budget reduced, our current Western society’s paradigm will be over.\n\nOther candidates I’ve considered are Visa ($V), Microsoft ($MSFT) and Amazon ($AMZN), but I could see all those titans being disrupted someday in the next 50 years.\n\nHow about you? What’s the stock you think you’ll never sell?",

As a result, debit networks face what Visa calls \"a chicken-and-egg problem.\" To be successful, the network needs many issuers and acquirers to accept the network. But issuers are unlikely to join the debit network unless many merchants already use the network. And merchants are unlikely to join the network unless their customers have cards that work with the network, which requires the issuer to have activated the network. As Visa itself observes, \"build[ing] scale on both sides... with consumers/payers and with merchants/payees\" is \"a herculean task.\" Visa further recognizes that these effects create \"an enormous moat\" around its business.\n\n6. Visa's market shares demonstrate just how deep that moat is. Visa has been the largest debit network in the United States for decades. Today, over 60% of all U.S. debit transactions run via Visa's payments network. And Visa's share of card-not-present debit transactions exceeds 65%. Mastercard is a distant second, processing less than 25% of all U.S. debit transactions and card-not-present U.S. debit transactions. Other networks, known as \"PIN networks\" because they originally facilitated ATM transactions for which accountholders needed to enter a PIN, are significantly smaller.\n\n7. This moat is no accident. Coming out of the Great Recession, Visa identified two significant threats to its monopoly—one from legislation and one from emerging technology. Visa took steps to counter both, enriching itself handsomely in the process.\n\n",

Currently I have about $53,000 in stocks and etfs, mostly SPY and QQQ (thinking about trimming this position). The rest is mostly in CDs and treasuries, with a bit in gold and cash. I am fairly sure we're heading towards a downturn in 2025 and think that the potential earnings from AI in the near future doesn't match up with the valuations right now. Plus employment data and fed saying interest rates wont go back down to near zero levels (which I think the market has priced in) has me spooked. \n\nMy dillame in short, is do I continue to slowly dollar cost average my cash position into  stocks/etfs or do I wait for a downturn to go in? I cant shake the sinking feeling tht buying right now would be like buying in 1998/99 and that if I do ill wait for a long time to see real returns. A third option is to dollar cost average so slow (eg. $20k a year) that I will still be sitting on most of my cash when a downturn hits. Any input would be warmly welcome!\n\n  \nMany thanks,\n\n  \nA new investor",

I don’t have any expenses (no loans) and earn about $100/week from an on campus job. Should I move money that’s sitting in my checking into stocks? Should I move money from my Apple savings into stocks too, or is it smart to have just in the savings account? The thing is, if I move after graduation I may need some of my money, but I may not. What should I do with it in the mean time? \n\nOpen to any and all suggestions. TIA.",
