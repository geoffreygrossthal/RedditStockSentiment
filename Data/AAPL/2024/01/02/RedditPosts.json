        "content": "Going in to 2024 I feel in my gut that the big stocks are simply overvalued and due for a correction. And it’s become that so goes Apple, so goes a lot of the funds we’re all in. And this is not a knock on Apple, I’d love to own Apple stock but it gained a trillion in market cap with no corresponding change in growth over the year. \n\nSimply put, it just seems that the market must be expecting further currency devaluation, that we will soon be talking about most stocks in the trillions, or we’re walking on a tightrope going into 2024.",
