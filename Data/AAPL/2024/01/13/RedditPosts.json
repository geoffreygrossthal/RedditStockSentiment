        "content": "please don't judge me, don't joke about it and only respond if you're serious.\n\nRight when coronavirus was getting 'better' I exited all my positions and invested my money pretty much in 3 companies, Amazon, Microsoft and Alibaba. (33% each)\n\naround 60k in alibaba, at 185€\n\nTheoretically a good stock, e-commerce in china is not bad, alibaba-cloud is a good thing, massive company, numbers looked good. I'd still say that it's a good stock, if only there was no CCP.\n\nSo, it's been going down for the last few years, we're currently at ~66€, it was already this low like 1-2 years ago, recovered, now down again. 66% down for me.\n\nI'm not rich at all, where others bought a department or something I have my money in stocks, and a third of it is about to be wiped out possibly. Honestly I don't think alibaba is going anywhere but who knows what the CCP will do and if/when it will recover, to 120€ / 180€, who knows.\n\nMeanwhile the spy and all other stocks im interested in are at their alltime-high, i'm not about to sell with 66% loss, invest in something else, only for the market to go down because thats's how it goes.\n\nFor the last 3 years I thought \"let's wait and see\", and, well, I'm not exactly thrilled. Yeah it's trading at 7 PE, if we get positive indicators it could go back to 120€ I guess, already did that 1 year ago.\n\nAny opinion on this situation? Feeling pretty bad about this. Meanwhile when anyone asks me where to invest my answer ist (33% msci world, 33% spy, 33%qqq, set and forget). and what do I do myself? Well..",
