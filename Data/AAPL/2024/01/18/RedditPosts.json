        "content": "Hello. Apologies if this has already been posted in this community. \n\nI came across this article by Jason Zweig in WSJ.\n\nhttps://archive.is/20231009181337/https://www.wsj.com/articles/picking-a-stock-for-the-year-2048-66d90e\n\nThe idea is to buy 20 stocks and never trade them for 25 years. This is an extremely long-term experiment created by Thomas Gayner, chief executive of Markel Group.\n\nSo, I have created an account with $5000 and I am going to do this. The idea is to get my kids on this when they grow older and teach them the power of long term buy and hold. \n\nSo my question is this. What 20 stocks would you pick if you cannot trade them till Feb 1, 2049. \n\nHere is my list so far. \n\n1. Amazon/Google/Microsoft/Apple (combined them here.. can get all 4 or pick 1-2 )\n2. Costco\n3. Johnson and Johnson\n4. Waste Management\n5. CVS\n6. Home Depot\n7. Boeing\n8. Caterpillar\n9. GE Aerospace\n10. Intel / Micron / Nvidia\n11. Walmart/Target\n12. Starbucks / McDonalds\n13. UPS\n14. JP Morgan / Bank of America\n15. Berkshire / Markel\n16. Disney\n17. Tesla / GM\n18. Hershey\n19. Dollar General\n20. Lockheed Martin\n\nNote that the goal of this exercise is not to beat the market. But instead to show the magic of long term compounding. After 25 years, from this list, the will be some losers and some winners. But hopefully, after 25 years, the winners will dominate. \n\nFeel free to post your 20 or make changes to my list.\n\nEdit: Some really good points in the comments. \n\n1. Most of my regular investing goes to VOO. Think of this as a fun little experiment \n2. Since all of these are mature large companies, maybe it makes more sense to go with mid cap stocks. In that case, what would you pick?",

        "content": "I took two shorts today on SPY. One right at open which is not normal for me( should’ve waited for a range or direction to be established) but I was focused on mainly that the higher time frame was pointing towards a bearish sentiment. I was also focused on a bullish dix correlating to a bearish market from my understanding. Then I scaled down onto a lower timeframe and waited for a fair value gap for my entry. Immediately after both trades I got stopped out before reversing down in which I would have hit my targeted take profit. From my understanding I should have maybe waited for a better entry and been more patient but from what I saw there wasn’t any better entry setups above my targeted entry. So where did I go wrong on this trade?",
