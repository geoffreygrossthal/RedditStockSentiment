If I took all the steps to ensure original packaging remained intact over the years, would it be a wiser investment than US Treasury Bonds that sit at 4%?\n\nReference:\n\nFirst Edition iPhones (2007) sold for:\n\n[Auctioned for $39K](https://www.wsj.com/articles/first-edition-apple-iphone-sells-for-more-than-39-000-at-auction-11666110568)\n\n[This one sold for $63K](https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/02/tech/first-generation-iphone-auction/index.html)\n\n[Would you believe $190K?](https://auction.lcgauctions.com/bids/bidplace?itemid=1102)\n\nEdit: This also assumes that I survive 10+years on this forsaken planet.
