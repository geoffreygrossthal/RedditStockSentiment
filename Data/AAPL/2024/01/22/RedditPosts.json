        "content": "This [Reddit ETF post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ku6skz/reddit_etf/) was posted at the beginning of 2021, near the period of peak euphoria.  Anyone who was around at the time can testify that this really did represent consensus opinions in this sub at that time, which you can see in the comments of that post.  Note that the game store madness did not really begin until a couple weeks later, which is why it did not appear here.\n\nI felt like it was going to play out poorly so I bookmarked it, and now have been doing yearly updates to see how the sharp, financial geniuses of the time did.  After all, for something like this, you really need to give it a multiple year timeline at least.  All 2024 prices use the closing price Friday.\n\n*I used a $100,000 initial investment and just rounded all the prices to the dollar for visual simplicity (all entries use the real, full prices, I have just rounded them for this table).  This also backtracks prices from stock splits.*\n\n|**TICKER**|**Jan8, 2021**|**Jan19, 2024**|**% change**|**Initial $**|**Final $**|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|TSLA|293|209|\\-29%|5000|3558|\n|AMD|95|174|\\+83%|5000|9170|\n|PLTR|25|17|\\-33%|5000|3356|\n|ICLN|33|14|\\-58%|5000|2084|\n|NIO|59|6|\\-90%|5000|514|\n|SQ|241|66|\\-73%|5000|1366|\n|NET|79|81|\\+3%|5000|5149|\n|DKNG|52|38|\\-28%|5000|3617|\n|NVDA|133|595|\\+347%|5000|22354|\n|AAPL|132|192|\\+45%|5000|7256|\n|ENPH|207|104|\\-50%|5000|2502|\n|PLUG|67|3|\\-96%|5000|200|\n|SE|210|36|\\-83%|4000|693|\n|BABA|263|69|\\-74%|4000|1056|\n|CRSP|164|62|\\-62%|4000|1512|\n|TSM|119|114|\\-4%|4000|3839|\n|AMZN|159|155|\\-2%|4000|3908|\n|DIS|179|93|\\-48%|4000|2080|\n|ABNB|150|140|\\-7%|4000|3732|\n|FSLY|88|19|\\-79%|3000|640|\n|CRM|222|281|\\+27%|3000|3796|\n|ARKG|106|29|\\-73%|2000|544|\n|JMIA|37|3|\\-92%|2000|158|\n|JD|92|22|\\-76%|2000|485|\n|**TOTAL**|\\-|\\-|**-16%**|**$100,000**|**$83,579**|\n\nHm, down 16% that's not so bad.
