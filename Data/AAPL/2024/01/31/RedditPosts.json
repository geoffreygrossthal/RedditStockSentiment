Eventually that went away due to Facebook changing to Meta and the stock getting crushed, along with Netflix hurting.\n\nNext came the Magnificient 7 aka Mag7, which has been Tesla, Nvidia, Apple, Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft.  Now with Tesla and Apple slowing, that has quickly ended.\n\nFinally we've hit the new one called Ai5 of the top 5 AI stocks in MSFT, TSMC, Broadcom, Nvidia, AMD\n\nSo what comes next?",
