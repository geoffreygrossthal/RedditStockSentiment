        "content": "Nvidia stock jumps over 6% by the end of the trading day on January 8, 2024, making one share worth $524.36. Everyone who knows something knows to keep an eye on Nvidia but it just keeps getting better and better. Being at an all-time high despite some analysts believing it could be out performed in the AI industry I still believe it is nowhere near its intrinsic value and therefore is still a good buy in my opinion. With Nvidia(NVDA) being at an all-time high what are your thoughts on this stock? Will you be buying more in 2024 despite the high price of this stock?",
