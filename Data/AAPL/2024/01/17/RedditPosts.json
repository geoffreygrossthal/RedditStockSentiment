        "content": "This company fucking sucks. They have zero moat and got bailed out by the crypto and AI boom. Now everyone thinks this is some kind of sound investment for the future. \n\nThese assholes don’t even do anything that adds value plus nobody wants to work there because everyone’s fucking rich and doesn’t care. \n\nSomehow they managed to achieve a trillion dollar market cap based on instruction manuals.\n\nIf Apple would get there shit together this would have been over a long time ago. \n\nSteve Jobs would have fucked them up for sure if he was still around. \n\nWhen the stock tanks after they lose half their market share they can go back to the pond where they belong.",
