It came in the same month that Twitter’s billionaire owner launched a tirade against advertisers.\n\nSpeaking at a New York Times conference, Mr Musk claimed a boycott by advertisers was going to “kill” the company, adding: “If somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go f--- yourself.”\n\nApple, IBM and Disney are among the major brands to cut ties with the social media platform, amid concerns about lax moderation under Mr Musk and the billionaire’s freewheeling personal style.\n\nFidelity’s valuation cut, which was first reported by Axios, gives the company a notional value of just $12.5bn and suggests Twitter has lost $2.85bn of worth in the eyes of Fidelity in just four weeks.\n\nThe investment group, which contributed more than $300m to Mr Musk’s takeover, does not disclose how it values privately held companies. Other shareholders may value their stakes differently.\n\nHowever, Twitter’s own internal stock plan for staff valued the company at just $19bn in October – less than half the sum Mr Musk paid for it.",
