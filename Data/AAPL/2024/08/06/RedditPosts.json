        "content": "European drugstore giant Rossmann announced Tuesday it will no longer buy Tesla’s electric vehicles for its fleet, effective immediately, citing CEO Elon Musk’s pro-Trump political support.\n\nRossmann, based in Germany, said in a statement that its decision was “based on the incompatibility between the statements of Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the values ​​that Tesla represents with its products.”\n\n“Elon Musk makes no secret of his support for Donald Trump,” Raoul Rossmann, a spokesperson for the company, said in a statement. “Trump has repeatedly described climate change as a hoax - this attitude is in stark contrast to Tesla’s mission to contribute to environmental protection through the production of electric cars.”\n\nWhile Rossmann only purchases about 180 electric vehicles a year — and only had 38 Teslas in its fleet according to Bloomberg — the company’s decision to cut all Tesla EV purchases shows that Musk’s political decisions have begun to impact the automaker well beyond the U.S.\n\nMusk formally endorsed Trump last month, and said he was contributing funds to a pro-Trump group he helped create called America PAC. Musk is also slated to interview the former president, Trump announced on Tuesday.\n\nDuring a debate with President Biden in June, former President Trump dodged questions about what he would do, if anything, to combat climate change. And Trump has called climate change a “hoax.” He has also promised to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Climate agreement, as he did during his presidency, if he is re-elected in November.\n\nAccording to ongoing research by Morning Consult, Republicans in the U.S. began to view Musk more favorably following his leveraged buyout of Twitter (now known as X) in late 2022. However, this has not driven an increase in Republican’s “purchasing consideration” of electric vehicles here. According to Pew Research, Musk’s reputation with left-leaning voters has declined even though they are far more likely to purchase an EV.\n\nRossman’s decision follows a recent survey that found a deterioration in Tesla’s brand, attributed partly to Musk’s “antics” and “political rants.” While Tesla’s revenue increased 2% during the second quarter, automotive revenue dropped 7% to $19.9 billion from $21.27 billion in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nTesla opened a factory in 2022 in Brandenburg, Germany (outside of Berlin) and employs thousands in the country. At the end of 2023, the drugstore chain Rossmann reported that it had more than 4,700 stores and more than 60,000 employees with about half in Germany.\n\nTesla has faced protests by environmental activists in Germany who took issue with the company’s plans to cut down part of a forest and to use water for manufacturing in Brandenburg. Musk lashed out at protesters there, saying on X in March they’re “either the dumbest eco-terrorists on Earth or they’re puppets of those who don’t have good environmental goals.”\n\nTesla, Musk and representatives for Rossmann did not respond to requests for further details on Thursday morning.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/06/elon-musks-trump-support-pushes-a-corporate-customer-away-from-tesla.html",

        "content": "First not a brag. If you look at my Net ROI. That's the % I made relative to my account for each trade. I was trading from 3 accounts today. My biggest % return was in premarket when I played NVDL. 6.22%. Hopefully this sheds some light into the process. I loved stuff like this when I was getting my sea legs. (I'm no guru. just trying to make that cheese ya know).   \n  \nPlayed Uber in premarket and bought it on the open sell off. Reason being is Uber oversold on the daily and at Jan 24 levels. Door Dash just had great earnings and is seeing nice upward move. Listened to Uber earnings call and doesn't seem like they are affected by the recession. Very good call. Plus we had this mini crash and I expected a nice recovery today like yesterday, so I was willing to hold this as a swing trade if needed. Stocks can always go lower and anything can happen but with all of these stacked in my favor the risk was worth it. Picked up some NVDL when NVDA hit $100 in premarket.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s5lua21a03hd1.jpg?width=1231&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b0164daf590225012451f76a1cd827deb1da5b0e\n\nMy META short. Well one of them. My classic reversal trade. So butter so creamy and it's fat free. Thanks Anna Coulling.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1co0dy7423hd1.jpg?width=932&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9923e3cc782db4f612a489eb2e44472cefb3cb7a\n\nHere's one of the Uber plays. I played this from two different accounts. My one account I sized in on the way down once we were down I went full size in other account. I saw price slowing down and I saw support at the $60 level on Bookmap.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/8y6zkjsv23hd1.jpg?width=953&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3a363a38fce0715d647de9b825884e83bf47b4fb\n\nOk one more bonus one. This is another short on META. I shorted META 3 times today. So I saw this on 5 min and 15 min was showing Bearish RSI divergence. Look how price continues to go higher while RSI continues to exhaust and go lower. It was turning over at least a little bit. I don't need a big move down just a little move or a retracement to make my money.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/uaze944e53hd1.jpg?width=2133&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=afd7054107994866a4db5f0aeb338e0c7a5e0daf",

        "content": "For ages, the rates from the Bank of Japan have sat at -0.1%.  That is, until March, when they finally decided to raise by 0.2%. Shocking absolutely no one, life went on. SPY even had an amazing bull run.\n\nYet last week, the bank of Japan raised the rates by 0.15%, and the market began its sudden downward march. And Monday morning, we woke up to an event so remarkable that the media has collectively settled on the name Black Monday. \n\nMany wallstreetbets users found their favorite brokers, such as Schwab, Fidelity, Wells Fargo, RobinHood, and Vanguard glitching and stopping them from panic selling. Looks like everyone woke up, tried to log in, and these brokers could not deal with the spike in traffic. Just want to point out: Interactive Broker worked fine through this mess.\n\nThe lay explanation for the panic goes like this: A bunch of people borrowed cheap money from Japan, converted borrowed Yen to USD, and used that money to buy US equities. When the bank of Japan raised the rates, these people received a margin call and were forced to sell their equities to pay back some of the money. \n\nSo if I were to assume this is what's happening right now, it makes me wonder just how much of Japan's free money has made its way overseas, and how deep of an effect it has had on our markets.\n\nBut why now? Why did a 0.15% interest rate hike cause a massive selloff, but a 0.2% rate hike back in March did not?\n\nI am still skeptical about this narrative. The media tends to pick up random narratives that the analysts put out. Then all the media outlets copy each other and the narrative gets repeated until the sources are lost, and any information of value gets lost. But it also shows how easy it could be for hedge funds to manipulate the market by putting out statements and having the media distort and amplify their message.\n\nUSD relative to YEN had begun losing value since July 11. And by the time of the interest rate decision, USD/YEN lost 5% of its value. Since the rate decision USD/YEN has lost another 5% in value. So it supports the narrative that people are buying up YEN and selling USD. However, the selloff began several weeks before the rate hike.\n\nIt's hard to believe that this event alone is triggering such a deep market selloff.\n\nI have a suspicion that something else is happening in the market that we are not aware of. I don't mean to fearmonger, but there is a very real possibility that some smart people have realized that there is deeper trouble brewing, and have started a selloff.\n\nOf course, it could be hivemind hysteria not based in reality. Or given how hard the Japanese stock market has been hit, maybe things really are that bad, and we'll see some banks in Japan go under.",
