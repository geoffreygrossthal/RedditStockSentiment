        "content": "Intel executives are working with multiple advisors to formulate options to address its [flagging business](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/29/intel-intc-gelsinger-skepticism-activist-layoffs.html), according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThose advisors, which include Morgan Stanley and other bankers, will likely present Intel’s directors with options at an upcoming board meeting in September, said the person, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. The advisors are considering a full range of options, including splitting off and selling businesses, the person said.\n\nIntel shares rose more than 8% on the report in Friday morning trading.\n\n[Bloomberg News](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-30/intel-is-said-to-explore-options-to-cope-with-historic-slump) first reported that the company was working with its advisors to come up with strategic options. Spokespeople for Intel and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.\n\nCEO Pat Gelsinger acknowledged publicly on Thursday that the company understood investor skepticism and was working to address it.\n\n“We realize we have to operate efficiently with nimbleness, with urgency,” Gelsinger said at Deutsche Bank’s Technology Conference. CNBC previously reported that some advisors, including Morgan Stanley, were helping the company on activism defense.\n\nIntel remains on track to launch its next iteration of its laptop central processor, Lunar Lake, Gelsinger said at the appearance. But investors don’t see a turnaround on the horizon, and have pushed the stock down almost 60% this year.\n\nThe once-dominant company has been trounced primarily by Nvidia, which produces the graphics processing units (GPUs) that are are the heart of today’s prominent AI models.\n\nAlongside a disastrous earnings report earlier this month, Intel announced it would lay off 15,000 workers. The job cuts, part of a broader focus on slashing expenses, did little to assuage investor dismay. And while Gelsinger said Thursday that the company’s foundry business had roughly a dozen interested customers, the buildout remains costly for Intel.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/30/intel-working-with-bankers-to-present-board-with-strategic-options.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/08/30/intel-working-with-bankers-to-present-board-with-strategic-options.html)",

        "content": "A few weeks ago, I posted on this sub about how I shorted copper because I thought the price of it would crash due to the public backlash of how low quality the bronze metal at the Olympics was. I thought it was an intelligent investment decision and not a gamble (because bronze is composed of about 88% copper) but I got thousands of comments and dms telling me about how dumb my analysis was and that I should sell immediately and quit options.\n\nAt first I didn't really listen to these ppl because I was up a little bit on my positions, but then copper started mooning in price and i was down thousands out of nowhere, so I doubled down on my position thinking there was no way it could go higher and I took out some margin and bought more puts on a different strike price to average down, but it kept going higher. Currently I'm down about -$8.5k on my shorts.\n\nSince I only had about $400 of cash in my account left I decided to play around with 0DTE SPY options, I made a little money back initially, but then I woke up today and checked my account and somehow there was a naked call in my account that I didn't even buy, I was only trading long calls and puts but somehow it was in my portfolio and said that i needed to buy 100 shares of SPY as collateral immediately before it closes. I have no idea how this got there, I tried switching to a cash account but it said I had to close my margin positions first, so as the market closed, it automatically bought 100 shares of SPY and now I owe $56k to my brokerage. Im only 19 and essentially my life is ruined and I have no idea what to do or how I can ever repay this, I haven't even told my mom or dad.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fn0sfwybjvld1.png?width=2876&format=png&auto=webp&s=44426c7724c4bc2ed8e332dbf1586ed001a20ea2\n\n",

        "content": "Hey guys, maybe you know about this, but Siri is getting a glow up. Apple just launched an update and some of us are seeing a new “Apple Intelligence” in our devices.   \n  \n\n\nIn other Apple news, Apple is paying almost half a billion to investors. If you were paying attention back in 2018, Tim Cook, our famous CEO, said that though Apple had sales problems in a few countries with high inflation rates like Brazil and Russia, there were no such problems for China. But then, just a few days later, Apple decided to cut production and requested it from the suppliers, so I think it was obviously otherwise.\n\n\n\nAnd just two months later, Apple shocked everyone with its first announcement about the revenue cut since the iPhone establishment in 2007, causing AAPL to drop by 10% and resulting in 70B losses.\n\n\n\nThis led to several big scandals and lawsuits based on Cook's comments, but Apple denied that they had any wrongdoing in this case (and they continue to deny it to this day).\n\n\n\nSo, at this point, this whole story is going to an end because recently, Apple decided to pay $490M to investors due to the situation, even before the court hearing, so if you were one of those damaged investors, you can [check it out.](https://11thestate.com/cases/apple-investor-settlement)\n\n\n\nHowever, does that half a billion even come close to covering the $70 billion loss? Especially with all the drama Apple's dealing with in China?\n\n",
