A really bad habit I started \n\n-gambling mindset \n\nMy worse enemy, when I passed my funded account and had live money this wasnâ€™t really an issue and I actually experienced a lot of success in trading. Itâ€™s the challenges where Iâ€™m loterrly gambling half the time. But in the sense that I would win a trade and immediately think itâ€™s okay to loose it and overl leverage on a trade again to try to make even more \n\n- needing to win back my losses \n\nI feel itâ€™s so hard for me to be content with losses and I have succeeded in just taking a L and moving on but I still really do feel shit and like bad urge to want to get it back immediately \n\nImpatience - \n\nAs you can probably tell thereâ€™s a common theme of me wanting something immediately , similarly with my challenge accounts I would just want to be passed already and set and done \n\n",

Itâ€™s still no reason to run especially when AAPL reported another phenomenal quarter.\n\nAll Berkshire is doing is capitalizing on the gains and rotating money to short term treasuries as this economy unfolds. To add  INTC had a terrible quarter and will lay off 17.5k workers or 15% of the workforce. This is just the beginning of more layoffâ€™s to come in various industries thanks to our friends at the treasury, or knuckleheads.\n\nRemember it never hurts to unwind some gains.\n\nHang in there as we come to year end and the presidential elections.",
