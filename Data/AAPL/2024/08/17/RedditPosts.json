        "content": "got around 3k to invest and threw it all into NVDA when it was at around 134 dollars, it tanked my portfolio down to 2.1k and that’s when I realized that holding long term is way too stressful for me. Switched strategies and started day trading SPY and SPY only, made back my losses and then some over the course of ~3 weeks. I had no experience day trading beforehand, but I talked to a friend who was experienced in the art of trading and he taught me a couple of indicators and gave me a book to read, which I think helped tremendously as I learned that not being a smartass and trying to outsmart the market by going against trends/predicting reversals. Maybe this is divine intervention or unparalleled luck, but I think I’ll try pushing this to 10k by the end of august. Regardless, I’m quite proud of this, even though this might be pocket change to some 😁",
