        "content": "“Apple's stock price has crossed the $200 mark and reached a new all-time high in intraday trading, one day after the company unveiled its Apple Intelligence suite of AI features coming with iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia.\n\nNvidia briefly surpassed Apple to become the world's second most valuable company last week, amid strong demand for its AI server chips, but Apple has now regained second place with a $3.1 trillion market cap as of writing. Apple now trails only Microsoft, which has a nearly $3.2 trillion market cap as of writing.”\n\nPretty impressive rally by Apple. I think they have presented one of the more marketable and useful presentations regarding how their AI features will help everyday users. Also Apple Intelligence is an elite name.\n\nSource: https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/aapl-all-time-high-wwdc-2024/",
