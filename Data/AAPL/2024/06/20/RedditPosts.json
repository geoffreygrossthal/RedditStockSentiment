        "content": "EDIT: I bought 10 MSFT, thanks for the advice!\n\n\n\nHi all, I am investing $15k today for some long term stocks. I already put about $7k of it into 50 NVIDIA, $2.6k into 100 Palantir, and $480 into 100 RKLB. Was wondering what would be good to invest the remaining $4.9k? I am undecided if I should top off any of the ones I just purchased today (thought about increasing RKLB to 1000 shares if things look bright for the future) or consider diversifying further. I have also been looking at AVGO, ASML, MSFT, AAPL, TSLA, AMD, and GOOG. What are some thoughts on these for long term? Or any others that you would recommend?",

But the dang stocks kept dropping today. Finally flattened for an 8k loss. Worked my way back up to -6.5k and now ended day at -7.4k.  Just ranting here.  Please tell me how tomorrow will be since I need to make this money back.  Iâ€™m not gonna be able to sleep till I make it all back. ",

Buying long call options on Apple could be a smart strategy if you're bullish on the stock. I believe it will increase in value before the options expire in July or further out. Just keep in mind that options trading carries inherent risks, so make sure you've done your due diligence and are comfortable with trading them. Good Luck",
