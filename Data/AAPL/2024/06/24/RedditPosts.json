        "content": "* Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shares fell more than 6.5% on Monday, the third straight session in which the semiconductor giant has lost ground.\n* The losses cumulatively add up to roughly $540B in lost market cap, placing Nvidia firmly behind Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) in the race for the most valuable company on the planet. The Jensen Huang-led Nvidia briefly became the world's most valuable company earlier this month.\n* Year-to-date, Nvidia shares are up 145%, buoyed by a surge in data center revenue amid heavy spending on artificial intelligence.\n* Separately on Monday, Taiwan news outlet UDN reported that the GB200 GPU is in short supply.",
