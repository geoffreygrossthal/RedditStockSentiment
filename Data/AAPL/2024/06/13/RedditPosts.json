Obviously I know almost nothing, given I’m only a few months in, but pretty pleased that I managed such big recoveries after screwing up so badly twice, especially with the GME one, where after I realized how badly I messed up, I pivoted to a different strategy on the same stock and was able to make almost all of it back. I gotta start setting stop losses, man.",
