        "content": "I'm not at surprised at the knee-jerk small sell-off is happening after the Apple Intelligence announcement.  \n\nHowever, I think Cook et co nailed it.  They are  bringing AI to day to day activities, to the masses.\n\nApple makes AI capabilities available and  attractive a way that Microsoft, google, and fail to do so as well.   I think it's going to add a lot of Apple over the next couple years, especially as they continue to add features.  Smart to make privacy a priority from the beginning. \n\nAs it will take a while to implement, and apple is under DOJ scrutiny, and people underestimate apple, it'll be a while til it's reflected in share price, but  this implementation I think will pay off long term.  \n\nUntil then, some buying opportunities, I'd wager.",

I’m just trying to learn. ",
