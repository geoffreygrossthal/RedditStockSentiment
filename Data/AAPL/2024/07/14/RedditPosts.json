        "content": "As someone who spends a lot of time writing on every Apple device, I’ve run out of patience for the low quality spelling correction on macOS, iPadOS, and iOS. The slightest misspelling and Apple has no idea what word I am trying to write. Speed is important to me, and using the technology in front of me to speed up my writing is what I expect. Every time I have a mispelled word that Apple can‘t correct or offer any accurate suggestion for, I can copy and paste that misspelling into Google and get the correct spelling of the correct intended word. 100% of the time. To me, this is one of the most basic and useful examples of AI assisting a user, and Apple’s current offering is dreadful. There is hope with Apple Intelligence coming, but I’ve yet to see this example shown. If Apple Intelligence lands without serious improvement in this area, I will lose a lot of faith in what Apple is doing. ",
