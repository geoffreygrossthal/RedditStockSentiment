        "content": "So, I'm a developer and pretty big Apple shareholder. \n\nI have a new iPad with the m4 chip and just installed iOS 18.1 (beta). \n\nSo this is the first version of iOS that has some Apple Intelligence features. \n\nOnce you install the update you get prompted to join a waitlist to get access to Apple intelligence. I will report back with my initial experiences once I get of the waitlist. \n\nTakeaways so far on what they are actually including based on the onboarding UI\n\n- Apple Intelligence is available in English only\n\n- Siri has heightened context and can carry on conversations similar to other LLMs like ChatGPT. Interested to see if it's any good, and what the latency is like. \n\n- The creative features seem to be there a bit, with the enhanced writing and some of the image generation stuff. \n\nEither way, I'm not sure how many people even have access to this since it's on a waitlist, but I imagine that initially a lot of the perceived success will depend on the Siri features, since it will take time for the software ecosystem and developers to start pushing app updates that leverage the new AI APIs.",
