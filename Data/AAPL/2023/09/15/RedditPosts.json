In years past I received lots of warnings about try again later. This year was butter smooth. I don’t know if that’s a good sign or a bad one. In years past their servers were so swamped it too a dozen tries to confirm. \n\nExcited about this phone though!  Since the 12 series I have been waiting for this to add to my iPhone shooters kit.\n\nMay the periscope be with you.",
