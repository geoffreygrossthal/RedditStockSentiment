        "content": "I have a self-directed brokerage account within the retirement investment plan provided by a former employer.  I owned lots of AAPL within it, but was tired of paying the commissions charged by the outsourced trading platform provider, and decided to rollover the account to E*Trade.  However, they would not allow me to directly rollover the stocks I owned, so I had to sell when I thought they were high enough to have a reasonable chance of being bought back at the same price or less within a few days.  I sold shares at ~$179 about a week and a half ago.  The funds clearing process and rollover took longer than I anticipated, so I missed a few chances to buy a new set of shares when AAPL was still floating in the $177-$179 range.  \n\nNow the market price is around $185.  I want to be patient and wait for a sweet buying point, below $179, but I also don’t want to miss an opportunity to own AAPL if it continues it’s rising price.  \n\nHow low could it go within the next month or so?",
