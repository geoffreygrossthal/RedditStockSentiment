        "content": "Apple’s market cap closed at about $3 trillion for the first time since August after its shares climbed 2% to $193.42 per share on Tuesday.\r  \n\r  \nApple’s value officially crossed the $3 trillion mark for the first time in June and briefly touched $3 trillion in December 2022 during intraday trading. Apple stock hit its all-time high on July 31 and remains the most valuable publicly traded U.S. company.\r  \n\r  \nThe milestone is a sign of Apple’s durability — the iPhone maker’s stock price has risen over 48% this year — even as the company reduces its total share count through buybacks.\r  \nInvestors see Apple as a fortress with significant cash flow, globally popular products, and strong shareholder return programs, even as the company struggles with slowing growth and problems in markets such as China.\r  \n\r  \nIn Apple’s fiscal 2023, which started in October, Apple reported $383.29 billion in total revenue, down about 3% from the prior year.\r  \n\r  \nApple also warned in November that it didn’t expect annual revenue growth in its all-important December quarter, the first full quarter with iPhone 15 sales. Next year, Apple will release its Vision Pro virtual reality headset, its first major computing platform since introducing the Apple Watch in 2014.\r  \n\r  \n",

        "content": "In [January 2022](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/01/03/apple-becomes-the-worlds-first-company-with-a-3-trillion-market-cap), Apple became the first company to reach a $3 trillion market capitalization, but then that market cap figure [steadily decrease](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/01/03/apple-dips-below-2t-market-cap-as-investors-fear-further-supply-chain-issues) over the next year.  \n\n\nThat decrease brought Apple back under $3 trillion, but it happened chiefly because of what were described as investor jitters.  \n\n\nThis pattern repeated itself in [June 2023](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/06/30/apple-is-the-worlds-biggest-company-at-3-trillion----again/), as Apple's valuation went back up over $3 trillion -- only to again fall steadily immediately afterwards.  \n\n\nJune was when Apple announced its forthcoming [Apple Vision Pro](https://appleinsider.com/inside/apple-vision-pro), and since then it has also launched the iPhone 15 range. But while investment analysts have been mixed in their advice about Apple, there have been issues over the iPhone 15 [not selling as well as the ](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/09/04/apple-supply-chain-receives-fewer-iphone-15-orders-than-iphone-14/)[iPhone 14](https://appleinsider.com/inside/iphone-14), especially [in China](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/10/16/iphone-15-fails-to-match-iphone-14-in-chinese-sales).  \n\n\nOn December 5, Apple share price rose 2% to $193.42 per share. The trend continues on Wednesday morning, with the stock inching up in pre-market trading.  \n\n\nIt's not clear how long it will retain that valuation, however. Apple routinely buys back stock, and Apple has already said that it does not expect annual revenue growth for its December quarter. This is the first full quarter where the iPhone 15 range was available, but could now be the fifth quarter in a row where Apple has seen [declining sales](https://appleinsider.com/articles/23/11/02/apple-suffers-fourth-consecutive-quarter-of-declining-sales).  \n\n\n[https://forums.appleinsider.com/discussion/234518](https://forums.appleinsider.com/discussion/234518)",
