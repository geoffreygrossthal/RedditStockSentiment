        "content": "So imagine that 60% of your net worth is already invested in VTI/VOO/SPY, you have 40% cash and there is currently a rising bull market, does it make sense to keep investing knowing that potentially every time you buy shares they will be more and more expensive? Wouldnt be better to just keep accumulating cash until a significant drop happens or we enter a bear market or black swan event? Kinda like following the counter cyclical approach and the Buffet's mantra \"Be greedy when others are fearful and be cautious when others are greedy\" ? \n\nWhat do you think?",
