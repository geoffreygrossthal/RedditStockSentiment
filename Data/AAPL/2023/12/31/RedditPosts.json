You should be  trying to guess whether firms like Citadel, Fidelity, Viking Global and Capital Research want the prices to move and in what direction. When they make those decisions, it is their own bank accounts they are thinking about, and not yours.\n\nIBM is short 27,365,207 shares at a price of $160 equals $4,378,433,120 shorts would have to pay to close their short positions. \n\nMicrosoft is short 53,704,127 shares at a price of $376 equals $20,192,751,752 cost to close.\n\nApple is short 120,233,720 shares at a price of $192 equals $20,680,199,840 cost to close.\n\nThat is $45 Billion on just three stocks that must be somewhere else changing the prices of those assets. It is their piggy bank that you are putting your money in. Be careful!",
