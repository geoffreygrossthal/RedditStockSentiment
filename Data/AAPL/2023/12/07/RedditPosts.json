I’m trying to think of examples where it would’ve failed too, perhaps SNAP or nintendo would be companies whose products I used a lot haven’t done great. \n\n\nRecently I’ve been picking up Sony because I love my ps5 and Robinhood bc of the UI, ease of use, and solid apy and IRA match. Anyone else really like a product so you buy the stock?",
