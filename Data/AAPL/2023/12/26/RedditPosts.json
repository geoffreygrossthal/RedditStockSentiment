        "content": "I used Airbnb extensively before covid and was a fan of using it over hotels.\n\nHowever, I recently tried to book a few trips to Hong Kong, Taipei, and Tokyo. All 3 cities have made Airbnb irrelevant. All 3 cities are heavily regulated so there are barely any listings and the listings are worse than hotels. They used to have plenty of listings with excellent quality and price.\n\nThat got me thinking about the future viability of the business model. \n\nI understand why cities ban it. I live in a fairly luxurious building and Airbnb is unregulated. On my floor, 11/17 apartments are Airbnbs. People rent it to throw parties. It's a nightmare for the residents. \n\nBesides that, Airbnb seems to have problems for everyone. City renters hate that it's causing rent to go up. Residents hate that their neighbors are random strangers. Apartment owners are fearful of parties and bad guests. Where I live, many landlords don't even know that their tenants are using their apartments for Airbnb. Guests are fearful of no standards, cleanliness, spy cameras. And we all know powerful hotel lobbyists. \n\nAs a traveler, it seems like the golden age of Airbnbs is gone. I don't think I will use it much anymore. 3/3 places I wanted to travel to recently have all but banned it. Therefore, I'm thinking of selling the stock.\n\nI want to know what your experience is and if mine is overly too negative.",
