ATR is essentially the high & the low of a stock on any given day. so let's say ATR is $10 - you can expect the high to the low to have a range of $10, roughly.   \n\n\nnow let's look at what it means for a stock to exceed and respect a $10 ATR. if ATR is respected, it means the price moves less than $10 and if ATR is exceeded, it means the price moves more than $10.   \n\n\nin the example with $AAPL here, we can see that on average, on Thursday's, ATR gets respected 68% of the time on Thursday's and gets exceeded 38% of the time on Thursday's.   \n\n\nin simple terms, looking at ATR helps you set your entry & profit targets, find reversal points and maximize winning trades.
