        "content": "After going through my ignorant trading phase (just trying things out to gauge temperament and learn strategies) I've decided day trading is the way for me. W/L ratio was great from the start, but like most rookies, let my losers run and cut winners short. Around 4/20 I learned how to properly imolement risk management on trades with stop loss points and exits planned ahead. Even with low current low volume this adjustment has made a huge impact on performance. A tale as old as time for new day traders I imagine.\n\nUp $2271.48 since 4/20 on 67:33 winner to loser ratio with average win of $238.83 and average losers at -$86.89\n\nYes, I know Robinhood is NOT the place to be day trading. I'm only taking 2 trades a week or so currently and working fulltime so it works for now. Robinhood now has 5 minute charts with VWAP, 9 day EMA, 20 day ect... so it's doable. Bought the laptop and switching to CME when I've built enough  consistency and honed strategy better. Just wanted to celebrate this tiny milestone with you guys.",
