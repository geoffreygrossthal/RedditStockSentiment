        "content": "Hello trading world! \n\nFor anyone needing a little of motivation to keep going in this game, I just want to share with everyone that after 2.5 yrs of consistently loosing, I think I might have finally found my edge in the market. \n\nWhat did I change that turned around in my trading? \n\nFirst of all, I stopped trading $SPY 0DTE.\nMost often than not I guessed the wrong move intraday. Second, I branched out to trading actual stock options but before I even place a trade, I always put the market first. What’s the $SPY doing and how are different stocks reacting to the price action in the $SPY? When I have a bearish thesis on the $SPY, I look for stocks relatively weak compared to the market. When I have a bullish thesis on the $SPY, I look for strong stocks or trade the $SPY itself ( if price action is clean enough). \n\nI have attached pictures of my best trades this month and my biggest losers as well. I’m just happy, my winners are finally outpacing my losers. Trading can be a lonely career, so I didn’t have anyone to share my recent results with. How’s your trading been so far this month?",
