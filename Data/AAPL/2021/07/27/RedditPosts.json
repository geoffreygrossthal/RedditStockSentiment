        "content": "Hi everyone, I’ve seen a lot of questions online lately from people about their iPhone’s battery health and whether their batteries are wearing unusually fast. iPhone 12 owners are asking things like “I’ve only had my phone for 10 months and battery health is already down to 90%, is that normal or do I have a defective battery?”\n\nApple has two main support pages about this listed here:\n\n[https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208387)\n\n[https://www.apple.com/batteries/service-and-recycling/](https://www.apple.com/batteries/service-and-recycling/)\n\nSpecifically, unlike Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch batteries that are rated to 1000 cycles, the iPhone’s battery is “designed to retain up to 80% of its original capacity at 500 complete charge cycles when operating under normal conditions.”\n\nThat means that if wear happens relatively linearly, you should expect to be down to 90% health after 250 cycles. Assuming you cycle your battery about once a day, then a brand new iPhone 12 bought at launch should, according to Apple’s typical expectations, be worn down \\~10% already, as it has been 277 days since iPhone 12’s launch day.\n\nOf course, it is frustrating that because of this, your phone has an expected 1.5 year lifespan before possibly needing a battery service on a battery that is not easily replaced.\n\nThe batteries can wear more quickly due to more frequent charge cycles, and especially due to heat. They also wear more rapidly when they’re more frequently pushed to 100% charge. So some suggestions for prolonging battery life include:\n\n\\- Avoid wireless charging as it does generate additional heat (this does go against using MagSafe, but it could over time save you a few health percentage points).\n\n\\- Try to avoid getting your phone too hot with regular use.\n\n\\- Use the features that prevent charging past 80% until the morning, and also always try to keep your battery level above 20%.\n\nBut ultimately the point is, I think we’re used to built in batteries having a longer cycle rating than modern iPhones seem to have. It’s unfortunate, and I don’t know why the iPhone batteries rate worse than other products, but the answer to the question of “is 90% expected at this time” appears, from Apple’s perspective, to be yes.",

        "content": "i know many of you will probably be in denial, but we could be at/near the top of the market. For the past year, Apple stock has been trading almost sideways, each higher high getting closer to the previous. However, the major pattern i am seeing is the same pattern that led to bitcoins downfall in May. A textbook Wyckoff distribution could be on the cards, and we are basically at the very top if the schematic remains valid. Buying pressure is clearly depleting, as those early investors are slowly, quietly selling, whilst CNCB and the likes scream buy apple stock you cant go wrong. Also, the STOCK IS NOT THE COMPANY AND THE COMPANY IS NOT THE STOCK. I would DEFINITELY not recommend getting in now, idc what anyone says, we have been in a inflated, money inflated bubble for the past year, and the euphoria is getting to people. If your a HODL type of investor, i would recommend at least cashing out 10-20% to realise some gains, profit is profit.
