I got too cocky winning 5 days in a row and I thought I could predict the direction of the market without looking at my technical indicators. All the indicators told me not to take the positions. I ignored them and brought 100 puts on SPY. I paid the price. Lost 5.2k.",

One of the tools we built is a \"[Reddit Dashboard](https://utradea.com/reddit-dashboard)\" which allows us to track trending stocks on Reddit. It looks at posts, comments, upvotes and overall sentiment.\n\nLooking at AAPL we have seen it move from #7 about a month ago to #4. \n\n[Current Position for $AAPL Over 1 Week](https://preview.redd.it/xbr1ed69tmd71.png?width=1073&format=png&auto=webp&s=d62436b22f2416c3739290e64f8ee73d71cb9e55)\n\n[View of the Top Posts That Mention $AAPL](https://preview.redd.it/v8pvyliqtmd71.png?width=1083&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e990d63b05cd8a3afa1ed89d84d3d58892bbadb)\n\n  \nEssentially you can get a sense of what is trending and what people are talking about on Reddit for specific stocks. WE are still working on refining the algorithm but this is our v1. [You can check it out here if you're interested](https://utradea.com/reddit-dashboard). Let me know what you think!",
