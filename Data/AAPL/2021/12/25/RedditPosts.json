        "content": "Was talking with my friends earlier in the week and one of my friends who was always an android user told me he bought an iPhone. He said that he uses it as his phone for picking up girls. Apparently, lots of (younger) girls view green text as a turnoff. \n\nI thought it was nonsense at first but I asked around. Apparently it's at least somewhat true. I don't think that this is a reflection of how most Gen z females think at all, but the fact that there's so many people out there that view iPhone and Apple products as status symbols just means one thing: 💵💵.\n\nFrankly I think these people are pompous, ignorant pricks but I love it. Apple has created a lifestyle with a cult like following. Not just an iPhone or an iPad. A lifestyle.",
