Yes, I understand individuals picking stocks aren't successful over a long-term horizon, but anytime someone asks what company looks better, 90% of the answers go directly to VTI or SPY or other index funds!?! \n\nIsn't the purpose of this sub to discuss individual stocks? I thought index funds were for r/Bogleheads and r/investing ?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks, and I will probably get downvoted for asking this simple question.",
