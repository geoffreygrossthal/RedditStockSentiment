After making so much this year, I wanted to buy a macbook air and see how good it was. I am really impressed.  The quality is great.  The screen looks amazing, sound is better than I expected.  I used the new m1 macbook air for about 2 to 3 hours and still had 92% battery life.  What a great year and what a great company.",
