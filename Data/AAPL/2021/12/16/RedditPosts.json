What a day for Apple, up $5 and almost $180. \n\nWith Fed & all good/bad news out,  I don’t see anything stopping $3T tomorrow. And the momentum will continue coz  so much going on at Apple. Having said that I start feeling giddy when my stocks reach my targets and I know I’m bad at selling so I’ll set my sell targets ready to take profits! Happy Santa Rally !!!\n🧑‍🎄 🎅 🤶",
