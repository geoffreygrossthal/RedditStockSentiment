        "content": "Hi guys, I’m relatively novice (8 months of investing). I lost around 20% of my entire portfolio value in the past 1.5 weeks, and I’m getting seriously nervous if that keeps going on.\n\nI know the rule: don’t invest what you are not willing to lose, but considering that my portfolio is made of solid stocks and ETF (AAPL, MSFT, TSM, NERD, VWRA and ARKK) I know it will rebound at some point.\n\nBut I have no idea how many more red days are we going to see, and how to deal with this psychologically, as it’s super stressful now.",
