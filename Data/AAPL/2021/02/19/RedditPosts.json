        "content": "People bought a lot of risky stuff. ICLNs, ARKKs etc.\n\nThese  people never held anything longer than 2-3 months, never went through a  market correction, never witnessed a scandal that wipes out 15% of  their position in a day.\n\nI am not  saying that asking about market condition is wrong but there are stocks  that don't and won't dip on days like these, less risky, more stable but  less sexy also. It's your choice to buy a risky investment and please  be prepared to see some losses along the way.\n\nGME  created a huge inflow of people to stock market subreddits and I am  tired of scrolling through thousands of posts asking about market  bubble, market correction. Yes some stocks are overvalued but we are in  totally uncharted waters given so much money printing, covid but also  investor beliefs in certain markets.\n\nYou  are buying stocks like AAPL and MSFT at high valuations, you are not  that person that bought apple in 2003 and has 120000% gains. Please be  weary about the other side of your trades - there are people taking huge  profits - if we will have a lot of them in a span of 10-15-30-120 days  we might see a market correction.\n\nIf  you are new to investing buying a stock feels like a very intimate  moment, sadly, a lot of people already own/owned that stock.\n\nIf  you want safety sell your positions and buy ETFs (stable all world,  maybe S&P), maybe go for a dividend stock like T. If you can't  handle your emotions make your portfolio all cash and trade on a paper  account.\n\nAnd for the love of god  don't call yourself a \"long term investor\" because you are bag holding a  20% loss. It might never come back, may come back tommorow, maybe in 7  years? You never know. We might see a bunch of people soon using that  term more often to offset that psychological game of chess with the  market but in reality you are simply not realizing that losses. I am  100% sure these LTIs are going to sell their position once breaking  even.\n\nStock market is a game of  psychological chess and if you are weak - you will be wiped out by  people with time, money and huge balls.\n\nPlease create daily/monthly/yearly threads designed for a discussion about bubble/correction or market conditions. There is so much noise it's crazy. \n\n\\#bringbackmaturity\n\nNot a financial advice.",
