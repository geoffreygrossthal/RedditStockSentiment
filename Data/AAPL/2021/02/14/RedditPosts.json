        "content": "I feel like there’s a consensus on stock forums that a catastrophic market crash akin to the dot com burst is happening soon. They use historical prices to back it up, and they inform anyone who’ll listen to sit on large quantities of cash, because everything will come crashing down soon\n\nIs there anyone out there that thinks that won’t happen?\n\nI can see a -20% decline over the course of a couple months happening in the next couple years. I can also see certain industries that are inflated to come crashing down. If you see what happened to [ZM](https://i.imgur.com/IumMxau.jpg) from October to December, I can easily see something like that happening to a variety of different growth stocks that are completely mispriced. \n\nBut we also have companies making a LOT of money that can justify a lot of the prices. AAPL made over $100 billion **in a single quarter**, and they’re growing 20% YoY. They have almost $200 billion in cash alone, and they’re innovating and finding new ways to make money. Why is a $2 trillion market cap unreasonable?\n\nSame with AMZN, MSFT, and other big tech companies. Unlike the dot com levels, tech companies are actually making a lot of money. I personally can’t imagine a -40% market drop that later stagnates for years on end when companies like AAPL have most cash in hand than their entire 2010 [market capitalization ](https://money.cnn.com/2010/03/29/technology/apple_valuable_companies.fortune/index.htm). \n\nI know this post is going to get of snark, but I hope we can have an actual discussion. The people who have been screeching “MaRkEt CrAsH iMmInent” are the ones that have been losing the most these last few years (by having large portions of their money uninvested in the midst of an incredible bull run)\n\nWith investors finally realizing the potential these tech companies have nowadays, and with tech companies making more money than what was once ever thought possible, does anyone else think a catastrophic market crash just.... won’t happen?",
