        "content": "Title.\n\nNews came in on the 5th of February - sharing from BlackBerry subreddit. Pretty decent sign, not a surprise they were downing the stock just week ago to get it to a lower price. Now more and more come aware of long term potential price for the stock. In the article they mention cloud partnership with Amazon, QNX, Baidu.\n\nEDIT: Short term thesis - buy; Long term - outperform. For some reason it does not allow me to insert a screenshot.\n\nEDIT2: [https://i.imgur.com/uRw30As.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/uRw30As.jpg) I hope this link works - screen from ZACKS\n\nEDIT3: some people are saying ZACKS is not decent source, but the sole fact that it's getting publicity as a normal stock, not a meme, subreddit driven stock is a positive note. I own \\~3500 positions at 11.94$ and plan on staying long - just my personal view.",
