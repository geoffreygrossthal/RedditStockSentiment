        "content": "The more in look into Blackberry and Connected Cars and Unified Endpoint Management the ***more bullish I get on BB***, on top of that Reddit is filled with CONSTANT confirmation bias. To ground myself I wrote a bear case, please help me add to it, ***the stronger we can make the bear case, the more clear we will see the potential opportunity*****.** \n\n# Macro: \n\nIvy will not be released till 2023, developers are not expected to get access till 2022 **Far too early to expect Ivy to benefit BB’s bottom line.** Without it, stock price will not moon.\n\n**Collaboration/partnerships** with 3rd parties (AWS, Biadu, IBM, Hyundai via Motional, Microsoft (crisis management/Microsoft Teams)) to develop technologies, products and services  **may not result in ROI**\n\nSome OEMS and tier 1 customer have accelerated **internal development of embedded solutions** could result in fewer customer orders, loss of market share, pressure to reduce prices, etc\n\nCOVID-19 Impact, Chip storage hitting the automobile sector resulting in revenue decrease of 16% in Q3 FY21, **could continue into the future**\n\n**Market is highly competitive**:  IBM, Microsoft, VMware, Mobile Iron, CrowdStrike to name a few\n\nTechnology landscape: **evolving customer requirements, high frequency of product introductions by competitors** could leave BB behind\n\nMaintaining key personal: success is dependent on ability to develop/retain skilled employees (executive team, R&amp;D team, experience sales people with specialized knowledge). Competition is intense, has resulted in **solicitation** resulting in higher compensation costs not offset by higher prices\n\nChanges in endpoints, operating systems and applications, security threats and industry standards \n\nMust obtain/maintain certain product approvals and certifications from government bodies and regulated enterprise customers, although BB is already ISO26262 certified (auto industry)\n\nBBs software runs on \\*3rd party operating systems\\* (Apple, Google, Microsoft, OEM op systems). **Updates to these op system with limited notice can disrupt operations**, forcing company to divert resources from preexisting product roadmap to accommodate changes \n\nMeeting debenture covenants\n\n# Financials\n\nRevenues have stalled, **growth is challenged** based on current financials\n\n**BB** (4%) **trails the average revenue when compared to competitors** **in each space** in Enterprise Software (5%) , Licensing &amp; IP (10%), Cybersecurity (10%), Canadian Enterprise Software (9%) per TD Securities equity research\n\nNormalized operating expenses have fluctuated although below average for last 8 qtrs\n\n**Hasn’t reported a profitable qtr since Q4 FY19** (Feb 2019)\n\nLet me know if I missed anything.\n\nCurrently holding ~400 shares @ $12, I started buying last week, before WSB happened\n\n**Edit**\nNew points added from the discussion below and my observation..\n \n**Perception: Many retail investors still consider BB a smartphone maker**, John Chen and the BB marketing team need to rebrand to change this perception. Other than their PR releases and twitter, I don’t see much else..i could be wrong..  **Although BB deals with B2B not B2C**, specifically they are niche with OEMs, governments, banks and healthcare.  One could argue no marketing is needed as a result, the security industry is well aware of the best products.\n \nWSBs: I’ve been active in the BB community for 2 weeks now, and **ALOT of people are bag holding, ALOT, which is why I believe your seeing so many pumps**, granted BB has been killing it with their constant updates with partnerships..not sure what came first but someone had posted a chart showing the correlation between BB, GME, AMC, and they are moving in sync!\n \nBB Cylance (AI and machine learning-based cybersecurity solutions) **was trending down from 20% of revenue in FY20 Q1 to 10% by the end of the FY.  Since then, BB stopped breaking out revenue between IoT and Cylance and now present it as one (Software &amp; Service)**",

        "content": "IMO:\n\nQuick summary\n\n1. Crush earning expectations but no guidance, that's equal to a no no for big players! So at $145 ath before earning the price already priced in for them pro to take profits while amateurs got burned with their options play speculations.\n\n2. Sector rotation, big boys took some profits to balance their portfolios. Plus big shorts hedge funds need to cover their losses from meme stocks AMC/GME etc. From profits taken from faang stocks.\n\n3. Government-bond-yields rising which is not good for technology stocks, cuz they benefit from low interest rate. This is making Institutions reassessing their risky plays on over-valued stocks. \n\nEventually they will move back to safe haven, high-growing stock like aapl.\n\nOverall this create a good opportunity to buy and accumulated at these level as up right now!!!\n\nDo your DD.\n\nAs for options plays, that a whole different level. It's not the same as long, which is why many got burned.",
