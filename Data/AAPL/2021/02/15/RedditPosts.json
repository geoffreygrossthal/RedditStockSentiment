Don't say \"Well, I really think this company is gonna go to the moon, but I already made 20%, I don't wanna be greedy.\" Making an arbitrary decision to sell and ignore your data is always a bad idea. \n\nIf this is all your life savings, take your 20% sure, there are always unforeseen risks. But if this is money you can afford to lose, and you've truly put in the work on your DD, don't second guess yourself out of fear. \n\nDon't be a pig but don't be Ronald Wayne.\n\nEdit/Correction: Wayne made an additional $1500 from selling his Apple stake, totalling $2300.",
