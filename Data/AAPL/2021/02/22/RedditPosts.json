I canâ€™t speak for what markets might do, but if you like me have extreme confidence in Apple, then use days like to today to buy dips. Every 2% drop I have limits to buy. I add more at each drop to help lower my average cost. Iâ€™ve been doing this for 10 years and always have made over 1000% returns. Currently holding around 1700 shares and adding at each dip. Apple is a long term savings account that is safer then anything else IMO.",

Sector rotation started around October/November of 2020. Retail players are usually several steps behind on their moves. I got in SLB at around $23 for energy play from last year.\n\nAapl is starting to be oversold below $126/$127 level...thus, imo accumulating with confidence!!!",
