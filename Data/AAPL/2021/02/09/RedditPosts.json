        "content": "They are the forefront in the AI Autonomous cyber security software market, there is no other competitors besides Google, but does not have the patents and broad variety of software that BB provides. Partnerships with the 19 of the top 25 EV companies which make up 61% of the EV market. Not to mention the recent deal with ticker: BIDU to provide their QNX System to over 175 million EV’s. They’ve successfully moved on from their product sales of phones and at most majority of revenue comes from the software they provide to homes, stations, and EVs. \n\nThey have completely wiped their department, obviously bringing in the Almighty papa chen who’s know for reviving software companies such as Sybase! A billion dollar software company with reported 55 consecutive profitable quarterly earning reports before they were bought out by SAP. Chen also announced today they signed a contract to provide power and cyber security to ISS for the next moon landing.\n\nIf you look at the analytics of their department, they revamped the company completely. By browsing linkedin they have a 3:1 ratio of engineers to sales, which means they are keen on developing their product and not so worried about sales. \n\nEdit: I also want to point out by looking at the TA from February 2nd on, BB is the only stock with a higher moving average to that of GME AMC and NOK. Throughout last week we can see it breaking the meme trend and acting on its own. Sorry I’m not sure how to add pictures but if you have the resources, you’ll see if you overlay all 4 stocks, they move very similar, but BB is the only one that breaks out right before market close. \n\nEdit 2: There’s a rumor that BB executives sold shares with the incentive to leave, remit ownership from BB, or have concerns of company being overvalued. Shares given to these executives are part of their salary compensation, so under company policy, they have every right to sell shares for capital gains. You can google search this yourself if you don’t believe so. \n\nEOY target is $60\n\nBB Literally to the moon \n\n17c 3/5 @20",
