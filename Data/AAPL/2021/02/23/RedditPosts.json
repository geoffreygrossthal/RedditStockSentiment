        "content": "A friend just messaged me saying that his portfolio lost 10% of its value recently and that this was complete doomsday. Judging by the futures, the NQ is down 6.8% from its highs (a 1.8% gap down this morning alone). I get that, it's frustrating.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the sell-off hurts technology stocks in particular. But mind that they were also the largest beneficiary in recent months:\n\n* Nasdaq 100 is 53% above its weekly 200 EMA.\n* S&P 500 is 31% above its weekly 200 EMA.\n* DJIA is 19% above its weekly 200 EMA.\n\nWhich one is going to be hurt first and foremost once a correction is underway? Of course it's going to be the most stretched industry sector. Information technology is 28% of the S&P 500, and 20% of the DJIA.\n\nIf you buy stocks, you've got to have conviction in them. You've got to know what you are buying. Am I going to dump all my holdings just because they're \"overvalued\". Of course not. I'm going to hang in there with stocks going down 30% and then come back up 80%. Even if that takes another 3 years. It's the nature of the market and it is great at weeding out the less convinced.\n\nVolatility is the price you pay for your returns.\n\nIf you held Apple all these years, you are sitting on a fortune now. Same goes for Amazon and many other megabrands of today. Amazon went top to bottom 60% several times in its history. You've got to have conviction in what you're buying to hold onto such kind of volatility. I also go to the grocery store to pick my favorite marmalade brand. If there's a 30% discount I'll pile up. But you cannot ever pile up if you don't have conviction in your holdings in the first place.\n\nSo here's what I would do. Go through your portfolio name by name. Ask yourself why it's there in the first place. Start with \"I own XYZ because...\". Warren Buffett had also advised it in one of his interviews. If you can't tell that story, sell it off. It doesn't belong in your portfolio. Free up that cash so you can pile in when spectacular opportunities arise in future.",

        "content": "Good morning everyone! Hope your Tuesday is a good one.\n\nI want to make a quick clarification and say that this post and list is geared towards day trading, and I am not advocating to blindly buy and hold these at all, in fact I advise strongly against that. \n\n*With the small cap stocks especially, I am typically in and out very quickly, only occasionally longer than 5-10 minutes, usually faster scalps.* I am also constantly watching the candlestick charts and observing price action and volume, and you should be doing the same if you want to trade these stocks. Always have a plan when you enter a trade (for profit taking and for taking a loss), and use proper risk management.\n\n**Large Cap Watchlist (*****over $10*****)**\n\n* Gapping UP: TCOM, ZNH, SM, ZI, UVXY\n* Gapping DOWN: CCIV, MARA, RIOT, CAN, FUBO, CPSH, NCTY, NLS, BTBT, QFIN, BNGO, API, SUNW\n\n**Small Cap Watchlist (*****under $10*****)**\n\n1. CTIB: Leading gapper, but couldn't find a catalyst. Seeing good volume and decent price action in the premarket. Premarket resistance around 4.25-4.27, with possible support near 3.53. \n2. BBIG: Gapping up after acquiring Lomotif. Seeing decent volume and price action in the premarket, with a premarket high of 6.76. \n3. DWSN: Gapping up following the seismic survey market analysis and forecast. Seeing good volume in premarket, but currently showing some weakness in price action.  \n4. CSCW: Gapping up on news of upgrade for AI and VR technologies. Seeing good volume and price action in the premarket. Currently has a premarket high of 1.12. \n5. PLX: Gapping up on positive update for drug candidate. Seeing decent volume in the premarket, but I'll want to see some more smooth price action either later in premarket or after market opens. \n6. ONCY: Gapping up on release of data for anti-cancer drug. Seeing decent volume, but I'll want to see some more price action. Premarket support around 3.40. \n\nAnother red open for the market today. Some stocks are getting hit harder than others, but it's not looking great. SPY is currently sitting just below 385, and we should prepare to see additional downwards movement. TSLA is down over 5% in premarket after dropping over 8% in yesterday's trading. Bitcoin is seeing some more selling off, and is currently sitting at around 48,700. Bitcoin-related stocks are getting hit hard. Marijuana stocks are also getting hit this morning. Not much green in the market this morning. I'll be watching UVXY and SOXS to try to take advantage of volatility and any downward movement. As I said in the recap last night, I'm a bit unsure of the market at the moment, and I will be cautious in my trading.\n\nRemember to use proper risk management, and make sure you size appropriately for your account. Happy trading everyone :)",

        "content": "Some three weeks ago I wrote in a post here that AAPL is heading for 120 before it stabilises and goes up again. \n\nI invest in AAPL since 1996. My today suggestion is you HOLD.  It can go even at 115 but it’s hard to fall below 105. \n\nThis quarter will test the limits of the stock. It’s nothing unexpected. The bears will try and make you sell. Don’t ! \n\nEven if we roll this way and reach pre split figures, rest assured that there will be a bounce. A good sign will be an above or an at least 10% increase on dividends. And don’t forget that we have 100$ billion in buybacks and APPLE loves to buy on the downsides. And remember to check on the daily volumes. All this drag favours the long timers and the hedge funds. \n\nDon’t panic. It’s silly. The stock needs to wait for the 200 Moving Average to break even with the 50 days. \n\nWait. The stock and Tim have a lot to give.",
