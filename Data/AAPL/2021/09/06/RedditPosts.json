And instead of being afraid of stock market crash. My thoughts were why am I keeping so much cash in a savings account if inflation is eating away at it each year.\n\nMy thinking is even if my portfolio crashes 90%. I would still have enough to cover 6 months of expenses. But the thing is if that worst case happens and SPY/VOO/VTI crashed 90% there might be bigger issues in the world than the money I lost. The best case is my capital appreciates higher than the .01% as well as higher than inflation it would have gotten in a savings account. Anyone else do this?",
