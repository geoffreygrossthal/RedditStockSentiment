Looking forward to this weeks market and the future iPhone!\n\nApple is just an amazing company when it comes to creating, marketing, and selling digital electronic consumer products! \n\nMany great reasons to own and hold the stock from inflationary pressures to cash flow or dividends of this high speed train. New rumored products like i glasses or icar. Finances that are commandeering with other consumerable services. \n\nLong and strong for multiple years!",
