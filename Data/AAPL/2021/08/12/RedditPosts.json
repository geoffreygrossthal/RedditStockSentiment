I just saw the chart where it’s bearish on Apple in the short, middle and long term view. \n\nI never noticed this tool on my app until today. \n\nThey are bullish on MSFT and TSLA in that same time frame which I find odd. \n\nJust curious if Recognia has a track record. \n\nLong $AAPL either way.",
