        "content": "Mental illness is among the most costly medical expenses in the U.S.,  and it has a high cost to employers in lost productivity. In 2019, 51.5  million adults were living with a mental illness in the U.S., and the  number of people suffering and drug costs, already in the tens of  billions of dollars annually, are projected to grow in the years ahead,  with Covid-19 compounding mental health issues globally.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDrugs long stigmatized, such as psilocybin and MDMA, are rising in  profile as mental illness treatment options. Just last week, results  from a phase 3 trial of MDMA combined with talk therapy for  post-traumatic stress disorder showed results that were impressive.\n\n“This  is a pivotal event,” said Elemer Piros, a biotech analyst at Roth  Capital Partners who covers the emerging alternative mental health  treatment space. “It may not seem humongous, but it is one of the best  and most rigorously executed trials in the space. And the results  corroborate what we have seen time and time again from smaller studies  over the past two decades,” he said, referencing remission rates double  that of a placebo. “The magical experiences kept showing up, but no one  had the courage to take it through to regulators.”\n\n[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/psychedelic-drug-boom-in-mental-health-treatment-nears-reality-.html?\\_\\_source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.Message](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/10/psychedelic-drug-boom-in-mental-health-treatment-nears-reality-.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.Message)",
