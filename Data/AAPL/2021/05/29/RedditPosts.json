Aapl stock has been in a 7 swing correction since the ATH's reached several months ago. There is a chance that when the market pulls back aapl could get to 110 range before a ton of buyers step in. I do believe that a back to tech rotation will happen after the next leg down, so there is light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nIf interested in my analysis please see video at link below\n\nNote: I am not a financial advisor and I do not short aapl stock. I am long the stock but use wave theory to pick scalp and cut loss points.\n\n[https://youtu.be/e4EePsKgwkM](https://youtu.be/e4EePsKgwkM)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: had a lot dms of questions regarding wave theory, so here is wave theory explanation video [https://youtu.be/e7EzSm1NI68](https://youtu.be/e7EzSm1NI68) ",
