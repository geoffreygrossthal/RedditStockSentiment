        "content": "As any Day Trader knows **a lot** goes into being consistently successful.\n\nFor this post I am going to focus on **one** technique - it is not the only thing one should focus on, nor should it replace indicators that are currently working for you.\n\nAs a final caveat (and on Reddit caveats *are* needed) - *this does not apply to momentum-based trades on low-priced gappers that you are trading within the first 30 minutes.*\n\nIt is really quite simple - roughly 70-80% of all stocks follow the market.  And when I say \"market\" here, I am referring primarily to the S&P 500, which is reflected in the **SPY** ETF.   However, you'll notice that every day there are some stocks that seems to be relatively strong or weak against SPY.   Sometimes this is due to a news event or earnings, but others the stock is just weak/strong on its own.\n\nThere are four types of these stocks:\n\n**1) SPY is up, but this stock is stronger than SPY proportionally**\n\n**2) SPY is up, but this stock is down**\n\n**3) SPY is down, but this stock is weaker than SPY proportionally**\n\n**4) SPY is down, but this stock is up**\n\nThese are the stocks you want to focus on to day trade.  As an example on Friday - SPY was up, but at around 2 hours into trading **DGX** began dropping, even as SPY continued to push upwards.  Shorting DGX around 2hrs and 30 mins into trading, right around 137.50 and you would have made a quick $1.50 a share.  Seeing the weakness in the stock you could have even done a lotto play and bought the 135 puts which were going for about 20 cents at the time and within an hour were at 60 cents (a 300% return).\n\nAnother example on Friday would have been **UPST** \\- it gapped up $4 and then within the first hour is jumped up another $10 before pulling back and consolidating.  But then at roughly 1:45pm (est) it started to move up again, even though **SPY** was flat.  This answers the age-old question of - \"The stock is already way up, isn't it done for the day?\"  Clearly it wasn't and increasing while **SPY** is flat is a signal of the stock's strength.  Going long at 1:45pm (est) and selling at the first pullback would have given you $5 on the trade (as well as an insanely good lotto trade with the 100 calls).\n\n*Note I am not talking about RSI which is different than Relative Strength or Relative Weakness against SPY*.  *Nor is this Beta which measures volatility compared to the market.*\n\nTrading these stocks also gives you an advantage - if you are shorting a stock that is relatively weak against SPY and the market starts dropping - that stock will drop even harder.  If the market goes up, that stock will at worst just stay flat most of the time.\n\nWhen you Day Trade stocks that are not Relatively Strong or Weak against SPY than you are at the mercy of the market.\n\nIt is very simple, very basic and very essential to Day Trading, particularly once you are out of that first hour of momentum trading.",
