It's only a matter of time before this stock starts heading higher. This stock is consistently down when more buying at brokerages like Fidelity.  When is their flip date? Are they going to wait until fall? When they decide to go long, this stock is going to head higher.  I don't know the flip date. But it is coming sooner than later, buy aapl and hold for the flip.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe foundation trust, one of the largest in the world, sold all its investments in [Apple](https://www.barrons.com/quote/AAPL) (ticker: AAPL) and [Twitter](https://www.barrons.com/quote/TWTR) (TWTR), and initiated a position in [Coupang](https://www.barrons.com/quote/CPNG) (CPNG), an e-commerce company based in Seoul.
