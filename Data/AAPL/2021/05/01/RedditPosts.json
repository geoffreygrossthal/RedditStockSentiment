In the fourth quarter of 2020, Berkshire trimmed its Apple stake by just 3.7% to about 944 million shares.\n\n“We got a chance to buy it and I sold some stock last year...that was probably a mistake,” said Buffett.\n\nThe “Oracle of Ohama” went on to to say that Apple’s stock is a “huge, huge bargain.” “It is indispensable to people,” Buffett said.\n\n“The part it plays in their lives is huge,” he said. “A car costs $35,000 and I’m sure with some people if you asked them whether they wanted to give up, had to give up, their Apple, they’d give up their car.”\n\nApple is the largest position in Berkshire’s investment portfolio, in a bet worth nearly $111 billion.\n\n— Maggie Fitzgerald”\n\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/01/berkshire-hathaway-meeting-live-updates.html",
