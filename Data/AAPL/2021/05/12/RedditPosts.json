I truly believe in the long term future of AAPL and am definitely not selling for a long long time. \n\nMy philosophy is everyday AAPL goes below my current average I will buy another share to bring my average down. \n\nMy question is that with the lawsuit stuff going on should instead of buying a share a day if it’s below my average should I wait to see if there is a massive dip and then buy a bunch of shares at once?\n\nI know 39 shares and adding 1 share when it is down is probably child’s play to a lot of the people in this community but it is a good amount for me!\n\nWould love to hear peoples thoughts and advice.",
