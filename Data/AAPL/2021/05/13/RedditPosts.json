I have been an Apple fan since 2008 when I got introduced to them, I love watching their keynotes and all press media related things. It's just a company I enjoy seeing grow and I guess I wanted my first stock pick to be a business I enjoy and love learning about.\n\nCan't wait to keep adding shares throughout the years and smile at the progress!",
