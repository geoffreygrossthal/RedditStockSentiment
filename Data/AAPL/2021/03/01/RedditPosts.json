        "content": "I recently got back on Reddit after a long hiatus - the volatility in Gamestop and other names brought me back to r/wallstreetbets and r/stocks.\n\nLately I have been doing some research on Cathie Wood's Ark ETFs and am quite alarmed by what I am seeing. I am by no means an expert in finance, but I work in finance professionally. I spent 2 years on a long-short equity hedge fund in NYC right after college, and have worked in M&A for an asset management firm for the last 5.5 years. I am intimately aware of how active and passive (ETF) investment products function and acutely aware of the impact that investor fund flows can have on price and performance of an ETF.\n\nIn the case of $ARKK and the family of ETFs, it is glaringly apparent to me that all of these ETFs in the last 12-14 months have become victims of their own success. What do I mean by this?\n\nWe'll use $ARKK as an example. In the last 14 months, investors (and many of you) plowed money into $ARKK at a stunning rate - $10 billion in 2020, and another $5 billion in just the first two months of 2021. In conjunction with those investor flows, the Ark ETFs have developed what by any industry standard represent HUGE holdings in many of the portfolio companies, as high as 25-30% in dozens of cases. Many of these holdings are illiquid companies that don't trade significant volume on any given day. The combination of low liquidity, huge investor inflows into the ETF, and now enormous ownership stakes in the portfolio companies has had the effect of driving share prices higher. Much of the ETF's performance over the last 12-14 months is not a function of fundamental improvement of the portfolio companies, but a function of the ETF having to buy illiquid equity securities when inflows are positive. This may not be readily apparent to the untrained eye, but it is crystal clear for those with access to industry flow data.\n\nI ran an analysis on the weekly net flows into ARKK over the last 60 weeks, and found that portfolio performance of the ETF was highly correlated with ETF inflows.\n\n***Correlation of 70%***\n\n***R-squared of 0.49*** \n\nThat is to say, the tail is wagging the dog! ARKK has created its own good performance, but not because the companies have grown or fundamentally improved. Nearly entirely the result of the ETF buying.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nLast week was a taste of the trouble ahead. When investors sell the ETF instead of buy, in order to cash out the investors the ETF must sell some of the stock in its portfolio companies, except that liquidity or lack of liquidity becomes a much bigger problem when investors are selling and when the broad equity/tech markets have a correction.\n\nThe ARKK ETF price has appreciated nearly 350% in a very short time. Now that Cathie Wood represents a big chunk of the outstanding shares within companies that have become overvalued by almost all measures, and trade with very thin liquidity, any meaningful reversal in investor flows (out instead of in) will result in a cascading collapse of the Ark ETFs. If the fund can generate returns of 350% in roughly a year, just imagine what may happen if investors move toward the exits in a much shorter period of time.\n\nAs someone who takes pride in my analytical work, and who is concerned about the limited investor knowledge of many people who own Cathie Wood's funds, I would strongly encourage you to do more research. Learn about the companies held by the ETFs. Try to educate yourselves on valuation methods. And please understand that unless you are willing to lose every dollar that you have invested with Ark, you should take some time to reflect on the risks you are taking.\n\nAfter spending a very short amount of time on this subreddit and others, I am concerned that many people may not be aware of these risks, and unfortunately the small investors in Cathie's funds will be the ones who bear the brunt of any crisis.\n\nAs usual with Wall Street, the insiders like Cathie Wood will get huge payouts and the little guys will get to hold the bag. It is not widely known, but good food for thought that Cathie has sold a chunk of her company to American Beacon. In recent months there were changes to these ownership arrangements that are not publicly known. Whatever happens, Cathie Wood will be just fine, but the small investors may not be.\n\nGood luck and I hope I am wrong.\n\n*****************\n\n***Edit*** - for inquiring minds, the link below is a detailed and succinct overview of some of these concerns from a Fintwit personality.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1366028953828270082\n\n***Edit*** - some have pushed back on the analysis and I appreciate the discussion, for additional thoughts on how some of these ETF products (and ETF's in general) can create distortions in the market, there are a few podcasts below that I found pretty worthwhile.\n\nhttps://www.zer0es.tv/interviews-and-analysis/the-perversion-of-passive-investment/\n\nhttps://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-end-game-ep-3-mike-green/id1508585135?i=1000483139066\n\n***Edit*** - some have suggested I re-create the analysis above on a number of more typical ETF products (great idea) to see if outcomes are similar. Some have also pushed back on the statistical significance of 70%/0.49. In finance if you can explain 49% of the variation using just one variable, it is pretty darn good. Not so good in physics or hard sciences.\n\nIn any case, here goes...\n\nBackground on methods and sources: Data comes from simfund, and the analysis is simple. We build a \"roll forward\" of the assets under management (AUM) for weekly flow data sets. An AUM roll forward is commonly found in the earnings presentations of all asset managers and is useful for understanding the sources of AUM growth in any given period.\n\nIn this case:\n\nA:   Beginning of period AUM        <--- Sourced from Simfund\n\nB:   +/- Net New Investor Flows   <--- Sourced from Simfund\n\nC:   +/- Market Performance        <--- Implied by D less B less A\n\nD:   End of Period AUM                <--- Sourced from Simfund\n\n\nIn this way we can see how many dollars flow into a certain ETF over the period, and how many dollars of market gains in the underlying portfolio took place in the same period. Presumably these two values (B&C) would be more highly correlated when B is large and the underlying portfolio is less liquid - causing upward pressure on prices for structural reasons rather than fundamental reasons, i.e. driven by the ETF and not by growth or fundamental improvement in the portfolio companies, i.e. paying a higher multiple for the same stock for no good reason.\n\nI think my analysis stands... but open to more constructive criticism.\n\n**********************\n***Output for Ark ETF's and compared with a number of other popular ETF's - Ticker: (correlation / r-sq)***\n\n*n = 60 weeks of data, which we focus on here because Ark products have seen such outsized flows (and returns) over this period*\n\n***Ark ETFs***\nARKQ: (69%/0.48)\nARKF: (64%/0.41)\nARKG: (42%/0.18)\nARKK: (70%/0.49)\nARKW: (70%/0.49)\n \n***Other Popular ETF's***\nSPY: (11%, 0.01)\nQQQ: (27%, 0.07)\nIWM: (20%, 0.04)\nXLE: (27%, 0.07)\nJETS: (21%, 0.04)\n\n***********************\n\n***Edit*** - Criticism of this approach may be that I am using dollar changes in both flows and portfolio returns, rather than periodic percentage changes, however my view is that it is the magnitude of the dollar flows that matters more than percentages when trying to ascertain the impact of illiquidity and investor flows.\n\n***Edit*** - Worthy correction from u/notredwan - I was under the impression that American Beacon was in process on exercising its option to acquire a majority position in Ark as was originally agreed in 2016. Evidently that option was extinguished in December 2020 in a deal where Ark took on debt (and likely warrants) to pay off American Beacon on the option value. Back of the envelope math would have put the option value in the $100-150mm range.\n\nReading here: https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1pw88ldyr905m/The-ARK-Invest-Takeover-Battle-Is-Over\n\n***Edit*** - An interesting easter egg in Ark's daily email update and associated disclosures. Quoting from the thread linked below.\n\nOn Friday, February 26, ARK expanded its daily trade email disclaimer to 718 words compared to 163 words on Thursday, February 25.\n\nTwo new disclaimers:\n\n\"Additional risks of investing in ARK ETFs include market, management, concentration and non-diversification risks\"\n\n\"There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue..”\n\nhttps://twitter.com/StockJabber/status/1365891480884289541",
