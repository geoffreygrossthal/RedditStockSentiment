        "content": "I swear almost every day I see some article about how BB has gotten some award or recognition for its software. Then there's the Amazon/IVY contract which will surely bring revenue. Also talk that their software will be used for drones. What that means, I don't know- sounds like money though! Oh, almost forgot, partnership with Bidu for driving software in China. None of this seems to make the stock move.\n\nI don't get it. It's maddening. You have stupid news like SPCE announcing a \"flight window\" for their overpriced \"space flights\" and the stock moves like crazy. You have partnerships with legit, in Amazon case, trillion dollar company, and the stock sits right at $10. \n\nWhat's it going to take for this thing to start moving? It's absolutely infuriating.",
