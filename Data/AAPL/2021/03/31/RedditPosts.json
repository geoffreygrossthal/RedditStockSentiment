        "content": "To whom it may concern: (I’m aware most of you know how to properly diversify). \n\nI see some investors on here being invested in multiple tech equities, APPL, TSLA, AMZN, SONO etc. and talking about how well diversified their portfolio is. \n\nJust a quick reminder than having a diversified portfolio means that you have equities with ‘negative correlation’, and/or no correlation in addition to being diversified into different asset classes (equities, fixed-income, cash)(ex. stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETF’s). \n\nOr into different market caps, levels of risk, growth/value, sector/industries as well as domestic and foreign investments. \n\nAny political, economical, or social catalysts that can affect the tech industry will most likely affect all your investors at the same time, in the same way, therefore just a quick reminder that having a portfolio consisting of only techs does not reduce the overall risk in your portfolio, and if anything, increases it, as such, you are not ‘Diversified’.\n\nThis doesn’t just apply to techs, it applies to any portfolio that only has positively correlated assets within the same sector/industries.\n\nEdit: This post is about the concept of having a diversified portfolio, not rate of return or investment objectives, capital limitations etc. Pls keep comments and topics relative to diversification.",
