        "content": "I’m sick of it. We’ve known for years that Yelp is a POS company. They extort businesses for good reviews and I hate having to deal with them. And yet, all of the reviews on Maps come from Yelp. I can’t even tap one to show the full review without being prompted to download yelp. It’s not acceptable for Apple to continue using this garbage company.\nTL;DR: Yelp is a terrible company and Apple has every capacity to get rid of them. Do it, Apple.",
