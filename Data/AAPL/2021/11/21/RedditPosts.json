        "content": "I have an iPhone 10. I used to have pretty good precision when I would type so I wouldn't  really need to use autocorrect. But within the past 10ish month my precision when typing has gone to crap. So I need to use autocorrect alot more now and the autocorrect was really good. But only recently (within the past 5ith months) the autocorrect has been seemingly getting worse as time goes on. Am I delusional or are other people experiencing the same thing?",
