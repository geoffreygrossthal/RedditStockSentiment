        "content": "As AAPL is currently undervalued by ~20%, the expectation is that it will surpass the $200 mark in the upcoming months.  Apple seems to have their supply chain under control therefore weathering another COVID storm might not be an issue for them.  \nFurthermore, the question of the day is, will there be a large enough pull back of the uptrend to load up on more apple shares before breaking the 200+ barrier.  \n\nThere could be period where people liquidate their APPL gains from the past couple of months posing an opportunity to buy AAPL at a lower price (for a short time).  \n\nWhat are peopleâ€™s thoughts? \nDo you feel there could be a pull back right around the corner?",
