        "content": "There is an interesting article back from 2018 that says\n\n>If you had bought the SPY at the last second of trading on each business day since 1993 and sold at the market open the next day — capturing all of the net after-hour gains — your cumulative price gain would be 571%  \n>  \n>On the other hand, if you had done the reverse, buying the ETF at the first second of regular trading every morning at 9:30 a.m. and selling at the 4 p.m. close, you would be down 4.4%\n\nI have backtested the same for 2020 and 2021, see the results below. Every day I was buying/selling just 1 share of $SPY.\n\n|Year|Buy at open, sell at close|Buy at close, sell at open|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|2020|$4.88|$45.42|\n|2021|$36.82|$53.92|\n\nDisclaimer: all calculations made using BreakingEquity",
