        "content": "I primarily trade S&P500 futures, and hold for about 2-30 minutes. Never overnight. \n\nI would say that on probably 9/10 days, my first trade of the day is usually either a big winner, or was a big winner until I held it down to breakeven or a loss. \n\nAnd then almost every single day, I manage to trade my daily PnL down to 0 again from that winner. \n\nI think it's because no matter how the first trade ends, it turns my emotion on. If I took profits, I get scared of losing those profits and trade fearfully for the rest of the day, which causes me to lose money. \n\nIf I lost money on the first trade, or missed out on a ton of unrealized gains, I get mad at myself and that also makes me trade with emotion. \n\nBut my analysis and execution on trade 1 is on point nearly every time. Probably because I go into that trade with a fresh mind and no emotions from previous trades that day. \n\nBut whenever I'm up a lot on that first trade, and I know that statistically my best move is to take profits and close my laptop, greed gets the best of me and I either take profits and then keep trading and lose the profits, or hold the position to a loss. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on building the discipline to walk away and shut down greed? Its very frustrating to see every day where I could be as a trader, but to consistently ruin it with my emotions. I probably would have tripled my account in the last few months if you only counted trade 1 of each day, but I'm no where near that point because of what happens after trade 1.",
