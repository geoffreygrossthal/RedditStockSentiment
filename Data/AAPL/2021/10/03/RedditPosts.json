Then the next day plows ahead like yesterday never happened and makes more predictions that are inevitably wrong.\n\nContradicts himself nonstop and most importantly has significantly underperformed the market according to some of the most recent studies ([https://www.ifa.com/articles/cramer\\_chasing\\_mad\\_money/](https://www.ifa.com/articles/cramer_chasing_mad_money/))\n\nHe claims to have returned an average of 24% over 14 years of his hedge fund operating although this data is conveniently private and highly disputed. How does someone who can allegedly beat the market by so much in his private hedge fund all of a sudden start preforming terribly once his positions are public? He shouldn’t be on TV giving market predictions let alone starting an “Investors Club” marketed towards “building long term wealth”.\n\nIs the entertainment factor the only thing that gets him airtime on such a reputable outlet like CNBC? \n\nThis is the same guy who was ignorant enough to openly admitted to illegally manipulating stocks in his hedge fund in 2006 in a video that he’s using his website TheStreet to flag and remove from the internet.
