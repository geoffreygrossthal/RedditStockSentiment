        "content": "The market has now gifted MSFT (a great but inferior company to Apple) with a 37 PE ad higher market cap. THis despite 22% growth this last quarter compared to Apple's 33%, and Apple notched 100% growth the quarter before.  You could also add the fact TSLA now has  361 pe and no chance at all to grow more than 50% and then run into plenty of stiff competition. Yes I know Musk is a cult figure and the market plays favorites all the time. But over time, real earnings and stock prices are what matters.  AAPL is enduring the supply chain slowdown now, but who isn't?  MSFT and TSLA are as well, in fact the entire economy is. Plus unlike other companies, any lot sales for Apple this quarter simply get pushed ahead to the next one, so they really don't lose anything.  My point is that in terms of mega cap tech at least, AAPL is the only one which is undervalued and it appears to be undervalued by at least 25%.  Comments?",
