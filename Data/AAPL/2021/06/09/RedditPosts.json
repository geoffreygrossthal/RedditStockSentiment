        "content": "'Soon, iPhone users will be able to hold FaceTime video calls with Android and Windows users for the first time. They will also be able to use a new feature called SharePlay, which lets you hold a FaceTime call and watch a streaming movie, listen to music, or share your screen with your contacts. IMessage is getting a boost as well, with new features that make it easier to share web links, photos, Apple Music tracks and Apple News articles with your contacts.\n\nIn short, Apple is laying the groundwork for a suite of social features designed to let you do a lot of what you would normally do on Instagram and Facebook, only with more emphasis on privacy. Think of it as a watered-down social network without all the bloat and annoying stuff you find in other apps.\n\nIt’s the kind of stuff that will drive Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg absolutely crazy.'\n\n-\n\nThe new features will launch this fall as part of Apple’s iOS 15 update for iPhones.\n\nFull article and source:  https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/08/apple-ios-15-new-social-features-will-compete-more-with-facebook.html",
