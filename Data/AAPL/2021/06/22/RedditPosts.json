        "content": "June 21, 2021 -\n\nWedbush expects the iPhone supercycle growth story to continue into 2022, with the recent model likely to launch in the third week of September.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives reiterated his outperform rating and $185 price target on the stock Monday.\n\nApple's (AAPL) stock has \"underperformed so far this year as the Street remains unconvinced\" regarding the pace of the iPhone 13's supercycle, Ives noted in a report to clients, but Asia supply chain builds for the model -- now at 90 million to 100 million units -- seem to indicate the company's \"increased confidence\" that this 5G product cycle will extend \"well into 2022.\"\n\nIves cited an expected boost from a \"reopening environment,\" as well as \"massive pent-up demand,\" given the approximately 250 million iPhones that have not been upgraded in at least 3.5 years.\n\nIves also highlighted the approximately \"$20 per share overhang\" on the stock, due to \"antitrust and regulatory concerns on the Street,\" particularly with the Epic Games lawsuit verdict and the appointment of Lina Khan as head of the Federal Trade Commission. That said, the antitrust headwind is likely a \"containable headline risk,\" while \"the App Store remains a very defendable moat.\"",
