        "content": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/03/biden-bans-us-investment-chinese-military-tech-surveillance\n\nJoe Biden has signed an executive order that bans American entities from investing in dozens of Chinese companies with alleged ties to defense or surveillance technology sectors.\n\nIn a move that his administration says will expand the scope of a legally flawed Trump-era order, the US treasury will enforce and update on a “rolling basis” the new ban list of about 59 companies.\n\nIt also bars buying or selling publicly traded securities in target companies, and replaces an earlier list from the defense department, senior administration officials told reporters.\n\n\nChips with everything: how one Taiwanese company drives the world economy\nRead more\nThe order prevents US investment from supporting the Chinese military-industrial complex, as well as military, intelligence, and security research and development programs, Biden said in the order.\n\n“In addition, I find that the use of Chinese surveillance technology outside [China] and the development or use of Chinese surveillance technology to facilitate repression or serious human rights abuse constitute unusual and extraordinary threats,” Biden said.\n\nA White House fact sheet on the order said the policy would take effect for those companies listed on 2 August.\n\nMajor Chinese firms included on the previous defense department list were also placed on the updated list, including Aviation Industry Corp of China (AVIC), China Mobile Communications Group, China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC), Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, Huawei Technologies and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC).\n\nSMIC is key to China’s national drive to boost its domestic chip sector.\n\n“We fully expect that in the months ahead … we’ll be adding additional companies to the new executive order’s restrictions,” one of the senior officials said.\n\nA second official told reporters that the inclusion of Chinese surveillance technology companies expanded the scope of the Trump administration’s initial order last year, which the White House argues was carelessly drafted, leaving it open to court challenges.\n\nThe president has been reviewing a number of aspects of US policy toward China, and his administration had extended a deadline for implementation set by Donald Trump’s order while it crafted its new policy framework.\n\n\nApple uses more suppliers from China than Taiwan for first time, data shows\nRead more\nThe move is part of Biden’s broader series of steps to counter China, including reinforcing US alliances and pursuing large domestic investments to bolster American economic competitiveness, amid increasingly sour relations between the world’s two most powerful countries.\n\nBiden’s Indo-Pacific policy coordinator, Kurt Campbell, said last month that a period of engagement with China had come to an end and that the dominant paradigm in bilateral ties going forward would be one of competition.\n\nSenior officials said the treasury would give guidance later on what the scope of surveillance technology means, including whether companies are facilitating “repression or serious human rights abuses”.\n\n“We really want to make sure that any future prohibitions are on legally solid ground. So, our first listings really reflect that,” a second senior administration official said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvestors would have time to “unwind” investments, a third official said.\n\nThe new list provided few surprises for investors looking to see if they need to unload even more Chinese stocks and bonds.\n\nBut some previously identified companies, such as Commercial Aircraft Corp of China (COMAC), which is spearheading Chinese efforts to compete with Boeing and Airbus, as well as two companies that had challenged the ban in court, Gowin Semiconductor Corp and Luokung Technology Corp, were not included.\n\nIn May, a judge signed an order removing the designation on Chinese mobile phone maker Xiaomi, which was among the more high-profile Chinese technology companies that the Trump administration targeted for alleged ties to China’s military.",

        "content": "There will be an inflection point coming. Bill Gates sold **all** his shares, Cathie Wood sold shares in aapl.  Buffett said he sold more than he should.  Who is still going to have shares to sell? This stock is setting itself up for reversal.  I don't know when, but it will happen.  Only hedge funds/big money when they are going to go back long.  I believe it is before end of the year.   \n\nTheir earnings are better than ever.  The reasoning that \"inflation will hurt tech returns\" is questionable at best. Appl could increase prices and people would still buy.  They also are making way more than expected in the app store if anyone if following the case. \n\nSo to buy a car right now I have to pay 2 to 4k over sticker.  But appl is worth 10% less? Anyone else see irony here.  If true inflation is here, aapl is worth well over 3 T.   This is aapl at 180$.  \n\nTLDR: aapl could be down short term, buy 2023 calls, you will do well.",
