        "content": "\nI thought I'd share my simple life hack if you're ever faced with a long quote time on waiting to speak with someone.\n\n1. Write down the number selections when navigating through menu over the phone\n2. Hang up once it puts you in line to speak with someone\n3. Redial and select French (Canada) or Spanish (USA)\n4. Press the number selections as if you're calling the English side\n5. Start speaking English as all agents have to be bilingual\n\nBy doing this I found that wait time lasted anywhere from 5 minutes to 10 minutes in comparison to 3 hours on the English side\n\nWith more new investors entering the market, I believe the queue will become even longer as more people invest and using this will save some time.",
