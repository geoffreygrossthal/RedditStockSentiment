        "content": "Value investing, at its core, is essentially buying great businesses at prices lower than their intrinsic value. Combine good analysis of intangibles, and you can find some really good plays. I feel, however, people have chosen to ignore the potential of lower priced, lesser known companies for companies trading well over their intrinsic values. Apple was trading at around 100$ in the early 2000’s, and the fundamentals made sense for a buy back then, but people didn’t buy it until it became mainstream. There are still many companies TILL THIS DAY that have amazing fundamentals, are in up and coming industries, and also have competitors doing decently well. If you can find these companies and hold on to them, then how is value investing dead? Is it easy to find the next Microsoft or Johnson and Johnson? No. It wasn’t easy in 1995, it wasn’t easy in 1965, and it’s not gonna be easy in 2021. But the notion that value investing is some how less effective would mean that fundamentals don’t matter long term. I think that’s a very dangerous narrative to push. If you’re not betting on a companies fundamentals for the long term, then what are you betting on exactly? Somebody to come along pay more for the stock you just bought?",
