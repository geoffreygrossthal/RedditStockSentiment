It won't affect facebook stock price because this is an old fixed issue. Now facebook stock is having momentum as the stock is trading near 52 week high. Economy is reopening and ads growth will comeback strong. There is no other way more effective of placing ads other than facebook. It is also the cheapest among faang. Investors should keep holding facebook stock and ride the momentum.\n\nThanks for the awards.\n\nEdit: Facebook is trading around $303. There is no selloff, investors are still buying facebook.",
