With Apple coming out with substandard news everyday people have lost confidence for short term gains, but what if I told you that that’s about to change? With analysts now valuing AAPL at $129 before the 9th from $123, people are going to be slamming the exchanges with buy orders only increasing the volume and the hype. It would inflate any news that would come out and rise to $129+.",
