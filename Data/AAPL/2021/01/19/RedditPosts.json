AMZN Prime members (52%) had an annual membership, up from 49% just three months earlier.\n\n“For the first time in four years, the percentage of annual memberships increased in the holiday shopping quarter. In other words, in the December quarter new and renewing members took advantage of the lower annualized cost of a yearly membership, and with that made a longer commitment to Amazon Prime. These new members will be around well into 2021.”\n\nAccording to a January report, eMarketer estimates global e-commerce sales of $4.28 trillion in 2020, up 27.6% from 2019. Experts expect 14.3% growth in 2021 to $4.89 trillion.\n\nThanks for the awards.",
