        "content": "I don't know about you guys but the first weeks I made some profits with trading (even if I lost everything shortly afterwards lol), I KNEW that there was no going back to working for $20/hour. I mean the first time you make your first $1000, $500 or even $100 in a couple of minutes on your phone... It's like discovering fire.\n\nAnd even if some (most?) will not succeed longterm in trading, you know you have at least to try your best.\n\nI wish you all a steady and profitable year 2021 **ðŸŒŸ**\n\nEdit: Just to clarify --> I am not a newbie in trading. When I talk about this feeling, I am referring to my debut in 2016. And I didn't quit my job at that time, luckily lol. Btw I don't recommend anyone to quit their job.",
