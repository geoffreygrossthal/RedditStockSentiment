        "content": "*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This entire post represents my personal views and opinions, and should not be taken as financial advice (or advice of any kind whatsoever). I encourage you to do your own research, take anything I write with a grain of salt, and hold me accountable for any mistakes you may catch. Also, full disclosure, I hold a net long position in GME, but my cost basis is very low, and I'm using money I can absolutely lose. My capital at risk and tolerance for risk generally is likely substantially different than yours.* \n\nRather than doing a writeup of Friday, I think the time I have at the moment would be better spent going over some conceptual market mechanics.  As I mentioned in my previous post that covered some light analysis of the week, my first glance was that Friday was a low conviction, low volume day where momentum traders/and volatility arbitraging HFT algos were skirmishing, and a slightly deeper look tells me that's probably the case for almost the entire day, up to the last minutes before close.\n\nThere was a bit of a push toward the end of the day just to extract maximum interest charge pain.  Keep in mind also that on Friday many of the retail brokerages still had issues with GME, and GME price was also protected from aggressive short-side attack due to the uptick rule.\n\n# Capital Flow, Liquid Float, and Price\n\nOk, so let's go with a diagram I put together while thinking about how to best answer a ton of questions related to the mechanics behind triggering a squeeze.  This is not very formal--just conceptual to help you think about the relationship between price, liquid free float, and capital required to move things around.\n\n[Capital Flow to Price Volatility Leverage Conceptual Diagram](https://u.teknik.io/DDa8Y.PNG)\n\nAs you can see in the diagram, I figured it would be conceptually clearest to model the relationship kind of like a seesaw.\n\nOn the left you can see that people selling tends to increase liquid float, moving the fulcrum of our conceptual seesaw to the right, except in the case of selling to people who are planning to buy and hold, which moves the fulcrum to the left.\n\nThe lower the liquid free float, or the further to the left the fulcrum goes, the greater the likely impact of any particular capital flow (net selling or buying) on share price.  Importantly, as the diagrams on the right half show, it's not a linear relationship.  The closer the liquid free float comes to 0%, the faster the price volatility increases... theoretically approaching infinity as liquid free float approaches 0%.\n\nI find it sometimes help to think of the extreme case to help clarify.  On the extremely liquid side, if you have all of the tens of millions of GME shares in play, dropping $10,000 in to buy shares probably doesn't even register on the ticker.  On the other extreme, if what if there was only 1 share in play?  That same $10,000 instantly prices GME at $10,000 a share--if you can even get the person holding it to sell!\n\nSince company value is estimated mark-to-market, GME would instantly become rated one of the most  (if not the most) valuable companies in the world.  This is in no way true, of course, as you could not subsequently sell all the rest of the shares at that price, but as far as a whole bunch of market mechanics and market participants are concerned, they would have to treat it that way until another transaction took place to re-price the company.\n\nSo, in the grand scheme of things, in terms of difficulty of initiating what magnitude of a squeeze, the primary factor is locking up actively traded/liquid free float.  Also important to keep in mind, locking up the float is only very gradually noticeable until you get very close to locking it all down, and you reach a point where suddenly each fraction of free float being locked up has parabolically greater impact on price volatility, reaching its limit where going from 2 actively traded shares to 1 actively traded share doubles price volatility sensitivity to capital flow by just locking up a single additional share.\n\nSo simple, right?  Actually, yes. However, don't mistake simple for easy (absolutely not the same thing in this case).\n\n# Market Games\n\nSo, GME and other high short interest stocks are looked at in two ways by many market participants.  On the one hand, you have normal investors and traders who don't really pay attention to it at all, and, if they do, they see it as a tool for price discovery that is otherwise neutral and dampens volatility (people tend to short stocks as price goes up, and cover shorts as price drops, so normal shorting activity is at least in theory supposed to help keep price stable).\n\nThen you have what I'll call market gamers.  These are people who are willing to look through the veil of what various mechanics in the market are theoretically intended to accomplish, and just pay attention to what they actually do.  There are a number of market mechanics that get really strange in extreme circumstance, and shorting is one of them, as using it to the extreme can absolutely crush a company's share price and actually harm the company badly.  The counter to that is the increasing risk of a squeeze, which gets worse with extreme price volatility.\n\nImagine it this way.  Short interest in a stock is like the stock comes with a very strange feature--a closed wormhole portal into the brokerage account of the short position holder that, if slammed with a high enough day or week end price, blows open and sucks their account capital through, and possibly their broker's capital too, until they've patched it closed again with shares of stock they were short.\n\nThat's not how you're supposed to look at it, but that's kind of how it actually works in practice.  Most wall street types would find it appalling and wrong to think about it that way, but with Millenials and younger jumping in to the market we're talking about generations of people who grew up watching things like people doing [4 minute speed runs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSYY4k52GEs) through games intended to take[\\~100 hrs](https://howlongtobeat.com/game?id=21614) to complete, using nothing but the mechanics of the game in ways entirely unintended by the developers.  That's kind of what GME is like, from a certain point of view--a speed run through the market, blitzing and confusing everyone watching--throwing a ton of money at hedge funds' short interest until you blow a hole in their account and suck the capital out with the force of a black hole.  Of course people are getting jumpy.\n\n# Battleground - Strategy and Tactics\n\nIn a way, GME has turned into a battleground stock in the minds of many wall street people.  Wall Street vs WSB is basically the way it's been depicted in the media, and a number of them seem to be taking it personally.\n\nWith a battleground stock I find it helpful to think of it like a literal battleground, but with territory marked out by stock price.  It helps you consider the impact on each 'side', what their motives are, and tactical and strategic implications.  The reason I think this way is that once a stock becomes a battleground, the issue is no longer about price discovery--it's about proving a point or accomplishing a specific goal, which changes the dynamics of the trade.\n\nIn my opinion, the retail strength/defensive line is at the $148 level as mentioned in my previous post analyzing the week.  This is based on the majority of volume being in the runup from $30 to $148, which triggered the first squeeze.\n\nMy guess is short-side strength hardens at the $350 level, based on that being the level at which the whale plugged the first squeeze.  What this means is that you can expect some short-side people to actively short more at that level, possibly following through on momentum, as many of them want to prove a point that GME is a <$20 stock, as stated by a number of them on CNBC.  $350 might seem like a low number given Friday's close, but remember that Friday trading was subject to the uptick rule, so the short effectively could not push back, and was instead fighting a rearguard action to bleed the long-side advance as much as possible, and lure them off their strength as much as possible.\n\nSay what?  Is there a point to those analogies like that?  Why yes, of course, because those analogies are very good mental models for what is going to happen in a short squeeze campaign.\n\nRemember, in the grand scheme of things, the goal of the long side is first and foremost to lock up liquid float.  That means buying and holding shares.  The question is.. how much will it cost you to move the needle on that, so to speak.  the higher the price the short side can force you to pay to lock up float, the longer it'll take and the more expensive it will be.  It is also like fighting far from your supply lines in that respect, in that there will be weaker hands mixed in far beyond hard support levels, such that quick pushes by the short side will shake them out, loosening float back up.\n\nHow about on the long side?  You want the short side to overextend themselves by shorting the price down on momentum, and hopefully get them to keep building up short interest at the lowest price at which they will do so.  This means having to have the patience to see the price go as low as you can tolerate before you start losing your key support to despair.  Why?  Because it means you're buying the shares they throw at you at a lower price (costs less to move the needle on locking up liquid free float) and also that their short position is at a lower average price, lowering the price it will take to trigger a squeeze.\n\nThe above is why, in some cases, you will see a sharp dip before the vertical move in a squeeze.  You can essentially lure the short side into an ambush by falling back to lower and lower price points, which allows you to continue to lock up free float at ever cheaper prices while the short side thinks it is winning.  Once you think you've accumulated enough to prevent covering without a parabolic price move, you spike the price back the other way and it's effectively game over.  It can take some time to play out to its conclusion, but that is the essence of it.\n\nLet's make it concrete and put some numbers to it.  let's say you need to lock up 10mio more shares for the squeeze (no idea, just using the number for easy math).  If you can buy it all skirmishing at the $200 line, you'll pay $2bn to do it.  If instead you've extended to the $300 line, you're going to pay $3bn.  If you're an alpha-seeking whale, why pay 50% more to accomplish the same thing if you can get away with it?  If you recall, I referenced seeing what I thought looked like this type of ticker behavior in my 3rd post.\n\nThat being said, you might not mess around with those types of tactics at this point if you think you're already close to blowing up the next short interest holder.\n\nIf you think you're close, then you're looking at the most efficient way to make the last tick at trading close as high as possible.\n\nThat is very similar to the price action we saw on Friday at the end of the day, as mentioned earlier.  If you think about it, if the goal is the have the price at/above a certain point at the end of the day, what is more efficient?  Rush in the morning, then have to pay that higher price level for the whole day to maintain it, or wait until later in the day, as late as you think you can manage, and then push to that point at the very last tick?\n\nThat, at least, is a very high level view of what you're trying to accomplish, but it gets very complicated in the details.  If you're dueling with a good HFT algorithm, you can run into things like the price getting spiked to trigger halts to run out the clock (kind of like fouling someone in basketball), which gets harder in the final minutes of trading due to the wider LU/LD allowances, but still doable, even if you have to do it by sucking price level up (maybe to give you 5 mins to call your buddy at Blackrock to dump shares onto the ticker or something like that).\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind.  One of the reasons these things can roll on for a long time, is it might not be a one and done blowout (possibly on purpose).  Think about it--if you can get people to keep piling short interest in--particularly for emotional reasons, you can ring the register as many times as they are willing to keep doing it to ultimately prove their point.  Think of the Citron guy who re-shorted back in around what.. $90 or $100 I think?  All because he wanted to make his point when he got blown out at the move off of $30.  There are people piling back in right now.  Who knows how many times they're willing to reload the short float.\n\nOk, so this post is much longer than I originally intended anyway, but I think the diagram and some of the descriptions above should provide a good amount of food for thought and discussion.  A number of people asked me why I said that price to squeeze was secondary at this point.  If you haven't already figured out why, try to think about it, or maybe ask in comments and someone can help with a further discussion.\n\nA couple of final points:\n\n* Assuming the long-side people continue to lock up liquid float, remember that volatility can get greater in BOTH directions.  This can mean that you get wiped out if you're somehow still trading GME on margin, as a quick price collapse can get you margin called even if the price quickly rebounds later.\n* Greater volatility means you should mentally prepare for big dips as well as swings to the upside.  Pre-market and after hours trading don't have circuit breakers, so it could get wild during those times too.\n* Also with extreme volatility you end up possibly hitting halts more frequently.  After the first frustrating day of this happening with GME I made myself a basic thinkorswim thinkscript study so I'd have a handy reference on whether it looked like this was going to happen.  For those of you on ToS, use it on the 1 minute chart.  Note that the LULD tolerances are different in first few minutes and toward the end of the day, so you'd have to adjust the parameters (or just keep it in mind).  I use it with the step lines vs the default line.  If price crosses the guard lines then you're getting close--if it crosses the circuit breaker line then you're about to be or already are getting halted.  Here is the code:\n\n&#8203;\n\n    input TrailingPeriodLength = 5;\n    input CircuitBreakerPercent = 10.0;\n    input GuardMultiplePercent = 70.0;\n    \n    def trlAvg = Average(close, TrailingPeriodLength);\n    \n    plot trailingAverage = trlAvg;\n    \n    plot upperStop = trlAvg * (1 + CircuitBreakerPercent / 100);\n    plot lowerStop = trlAvg * (1 - CircuitBreakerPercent / 100);\n    \n    plot upperRail = trlAvg * (1 + CircuitBreakerPercent / 100 * GuardMultiplePercent / 100);\n    plot lowerRail = trlAvg * (1 - CircuitBreakerPercent / 100 * GuardMultiplePercent / 100);\n\nAlso, I got a comment in another post telling me to get a job lol.  Actually I have one, so I'm not sure how much I'll be able to post from Monday forward.  As I've mentioned in a few comments on prior posts, I actually am not active on social media normally.  I just created this account to try to help people use this probably once-in-a-lifetime event and the intense interest it's generating to help people learn to become better investors and traders.  I'll try to keep posting, but maybe not as regularly, and probably shorter (which I know some of you will be happy about :)).\n\nHope you all have a good rest of the weekend.  Good luck in the Market on Monday",

        "content": "I have been following GME since mid-September and over that time I have banked myself a %1300 return in the process. However, the whole time I was a little puzzled with how severe the reactions from Wall Street have been, especially this week. \"The company had more than 100% of its stock sold short! That's never happened before!\", you say. I know, I know, but that's [not actually not a new thing](https://www.forbes.com/2006/08/25/naked-shorts-global-links-cx_lm_0825naked.html?sh=f59ff078400b). A short squeeze, even one of this magnitude, should have squoze by now with GME up more than 10x in the span of weeks. Something is just not right. **I think there is something much, much bigger going on here. Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**\n\nHere is my hypothesis: I think the hedge funds, clearing houses, and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME, possibly 100-200% or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop. In the process, they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now. What is that bomb? **I believe retail investors may hold more than 100% of GME** (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company). This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.\n\nFor you to follow this argument, you need to go read the white paper [\"Counterfeiting Stock 2.0\"](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) so you understand how the hedge funds can create fake stock out of thin air and disguise it so it looks like real shares. They use these fake shares in [short attacks to drive the price of a company down until they put them into bankruptcy](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D). This practice seems to be widespread among hedge funds that go short. There is even a term for it, \"strategic fails–to–deliver.\" Counterfeiting shares is extremely illegal (similar level to counterfeiting money) but it's very difficult to prove and even getting the court to approve subpoenas because of the way the financial industry has stacked the deck against investigations.\n\nThis completely explains why so many levels of the financial system seem to be actively trying to get in the way of retail investors purchasing more GME. It's not just about a short squeeze, it's about their firms' very existence and their own personal freedom. We have the opportunity to put all these people in jail by proving that we own more than 100% of shares in existence.\n\nThere are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via [13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme) that they own more than **102,000,000 shares** (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen). Now, I don't know the delay/variance on these ownership numbers, but I think there is a pretty solid argument that close to 100% of GME is owned by these firms, if not more.\n\nMoreover, there are now more than 7 million people subscribed to r/wallstreetbets\\~\\~. I know lots of people here are sitting on a few hundred shares that they bought back when it was under $50. Some of us are even holding thousands. If the average number of shares owned by each subscriber is even close to 5-10, we have a very good shot at also owning a similarly enormous amount of GME.\\~\\~ **Even if the average was just 10 shares per legit subscriber, that puts the minimum retail position at about 30-50% of the entire company.**\n\nGME has been on the NYSE threshold list for almost a month. We don't have January data yet, but I just analyzed the data from the [SEC's fails–to–deliver list for December](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) (all 65,871 lines of it) and looked up the number of shares that were likely counterfeit. For comparison, I did the same for a couple random tickers. Most companies have close to no shares not show up. Of those that do, it's a relatively small number of shares. For example, two random companies: Lowes ($LOW, \\~$125B market cap) had 13,960 shares fail to be delivered at its highest point that month, Boston Beer Company ($SAM, $11.5B market cap) had 295 shares fail to be delivered.\n\nHow many shares of GME failed to deliver? **1,787,191.** As the white papers points out, the true number of counterfeit shares can be 20x this number. How bad do you think that number will be when we get the numbers for January? I'm willing to bet its many times that. Look at how that compares to other companies' stock:\n\n[Histogram showing number of shares that weren't delivered in December \\(x-axis\\) vs the number of companies that fall into that bin \\(y-axis\\). GME is an extreme outlier.](https://preview.redd.it/g723jvyhine61.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=39bad6c47b428d364de36e9888de35b79572d1da)\n\nI think this explains all the shenanigans going on the last few days. There is way too much counterfeit GME stock out there and DTC, the clearing houses, and the hedge funds are all in on it. That's why there has been such a coordinated effort to disrupt our ability to buy shares. **No real shares can be found** **and it's about to cause the system to fall apart.**\n\n*TLDR; We probably own way more of GME than we think and that is freaking out Wall Street because it could prove they've been up to some extremely illegal shit and the whole system could implode as a result.*\n\nDisclaimer: I'm just a starving engineering PhD student and I don't work in finance. I have no inside knowledge of how the financial system works and I may be wrong on some of this. This is not financial advice and you shouldn't trade based on it. I am book-smart but I still eat crayons like the rest of you. Obligatory rocket: **🚀**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT 0: Looks like I truly belong on this sub. On the first version of this post I didn't read the file description properly and summed a cumulative distribution. My numbers were wrong, but I have updated the plot and post with the correct numbers.\n\nEDIT 1: You should also note this is the distribution for NASDAQ tickers, not the entire NYSE. I doubt that the distribution trend is any different though.\n\nEDIT 2: Evidence that Fannie May and Freddie Mac were killed in 2008 via short attacks using counterfeit shares: [report](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf). Exactly what I think they were trying to do to GME.\n\nEDIT 3: A lot of people were hung up on the \"3 shares per wsb subscriber thing\". I know many accounts are bots, I was intentionally underestimating that number. I have adjusted to 10 shares per \"legit subscriber\" to reflect this without changing the total amount I think retail owns.\n\nEDIT 4: What I'm seeing on Twitter makes me think I'm being interpreted a little too hyperbolically when I say \"Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**\" We're not going to go back to mud huts, people.** This could just be really disruptive for a short amount of time and cause a number of firms to face liquidity problems, possibly bankrupting some of them. Life will go on and I'm confident regulators and government will step in and protect people if necessary. Hopefully they pay more attention to enforcing securities laws going forward to prevent this from happening again.\n\nEDIT 5: [Backup link for white paper.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210131014127/counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html)\n\nEDIT 6: I am getting thousands of messages. I won't be able to respond to all of them. Here is an FAQ:\n\n1. *How do I learn investing?*I am not an authority on this, but my personal opinion is to first learn how to read a company's financial documents and value businesses and only then start thinking about putting your money into specific stocks. Read \"the intelligent investor\" by Benjamin Graham for this. Then learn how to think about picking stocks. I like Peter Lynch's books for this.\n2. *What is going to happen this week?*I have no idea and I wouldn't dare to guess.\n3. *Are you going to be killed?*I don't know where people are getting this idea. I have no special knowledge or insider contacts, and I am in no way, shape, or form an expert on the market or the system behind it. Please treat my tinfoil-hat conspiracy theories as just that. There is nothing to gain from harming me and I have no doubts about my safety. These are just personal opinions and I don't have any schemes to \"take down the shorts\" or anything like that. I do not advocate for you to buy, hold, or sell. I'm just postulating on how we might have found ourselves in this place.",

        "content": "This story could definitely have wide ranging impacts within the O&G sector - should be interesting to see how it unfolds:\n\n* * *\n\nThe chief executives of Exxon XOM -2.65% Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. CVX -4.29% spoke last year about combining the oil giants, according to people familiar with the talks, testing the waters for what could be one of the largest corporate mergers ever.\n\nChevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth and Exxon CEO Darren Woods spoke shortly after the coronavirus pandemic took hold, decimating oil and gas demand and putting enormous financial strain on both companies, the people said. The discussions were described as preliminary and aren’t ongoing but could come back in the future, the people said.\n\nSuch a deal would reunite the two largest descendants of John D. Rockefeller’s Standard Oil monopoly, which was broken up by U.S. regulators in 1911, and reshape the oil industry.\n\nA combined company’s market value could top $350 billion. Exxon has a market value of $190 billion, while Chevron’s is $164 billion. Together, they would likely form the world’s second largest oil company by market capitalization and production, producing about 7 million barrels of oil and gas a day, based on pre-pandemic levels, second only in both measures to Saudi Aramco.\n\nBut a merger of the two largest American oil companies could encounter regulatory and antitrust challenges under the Biden administration. President Biden has said climate change is one of the biggest crises the country faces. In October, he said he would push the country to “transition away from the oil industry.” He hasn’t been as vocal about antitrust matters, and the administration has yet to nominate the Justice Department’s head of that division.\n\nOne of the people familiar with the talks said the sides may have missed an opportunity to consummate the deal under former President Donald Trump, whose administration was seen as more friendly to the industry.\n\nA handful of sizable oil and gas deals were completed last year, including Chevron’s $5 billion takeover of Noble Energy Inc. and ConocoPhillips ’ roughly $10 billion takeover of Concho Resources Inc., but nothing close to the scale of combining San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron and Irving, Texas-based Exxon.\n\nSuch a deal would be noteworthy in the oil industry, surpassing in size the mega-oil-mergers of the late 1990s and early 2000s, which included the combination of Exxon and Mobil and Chevron and Texaco Inc.\n\nIt also could be the largest corporate tie-up ever, depending on its structure. That distinction currently belongs to the roughly $181 billion purchase of German conglomerate Mannesmann AG by Vodafone AirTouch Plc in 2000, according to Dealogic.\n\nMany investors, analysts and energy executives have called for consolidation in the beleaguered oil-and-gas industry, arguing that cutting costs and improving operational efficiencies would help companies weather the pandemic-induced downturn and prepare for an uncertain future as many countries seek to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels to combat climate change.\n\nIn an interview discussing Chevron’s earnings Friday, Mr. Wirth, who like Mr. Woods also serves as his company’s board chairman, said that consolidation could make the industry more efficient. He was speaking generally and not about a possible Exxon-Chevron merger.\n\n“As for larger scale things, it’s happened before,” Mr. Wirth said, referring to the 1990s and early-2000s megamergers. “Time will tell.”\n\nPaul Sankey, an independent analyst who hypothesized a merger of Chevron and Exxon in October, estimated at the time that the combined company would have a market capitalization of about $300 billion and $100 billion in debt. A merger would allow them to cut a combined $15 billion in administrative expenses and $10 billion in annual capital expenditures, he wrote.\n\nExxon was America’s most valuable company seven years ago, with a market value of more than $400 billion, nearly double Chevron’s. But Exxon has fallen from its heights following a series of strategic missteps, which were further exacerbated by the pandemic. It has been eclipsed as a profit engine by tech giants such as Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. in recent years and was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average last year for the first time since it was added as Standard Oil of New Jersey in 1928.\n\nExxon’s shares have fallen nearly 29% over the last year, while Chevron’s are down about 20%. Chevron briefly topped Exxon in market capitalization in the fall.\n\nExxon endured one of its worst financial performances ever in 2020. It is expected to report a fourth consecutive quarterly loss for the first time in modern history on Tuesday and already has posted more than $2 billion in losses through the first three quarters of 2020.\n\nChevron also has struggled, reporting nearly $5.5 billion in 2020 losses Friday. But investors have expressed more faith in Chevron because it entered the downturn with a stronger balance sheet—in part because it failed in its $33 billion bid to buy Anadarko Petroleum Corp. before the pandemic, having been outbid by Occidental Petroleum Corp. in 2019.\n\nExxon has about $69 billion in debt as of September, while Chevron has around $35 billion, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.\n\nSome investors have grown increasingly concerned about Exxon’s direction under Mr. Woods as the company faces a rapidly changing energy industry and growing global consciousness about climate change. Some are also worried that Exxon may have to cut its hefty dividend, which costs it about $15 billion annually, due to its high debt levels. Many individual investors count on the payments as a source of income.\n\nMr. Woods embarked on an ambitious plan in 2018 to spend $230 billion to pump an additional one million barrels of oil and gas a day by 2025. But before the pandemic, production was up only slightly and Exxon’s financial flexibility was diminished. In November, Exxon retreated from the plan and said it would cut billions of dollars from its capital spending every year through 2025 and focus on investing in only the most promising assets.\n\nMeanwhile, the company’s woes have helped draw the attention of activist investors. One of them, Engine No. 1 LLC, has argued that the company should focus more on investments in clean energy while cutting costs elsewhere to preserve its dividend. The firm nominated four directors to Exxon’s board Wednesday and called for it to make strategic changes to its business plan.\n\nExxon also has been in talks with another activist, D.E. Shaw Group, and is preparing to announce one or more new board members, additional spending cuts and investments in new technologies to help it reduce its carbon emissions.\n\nRivals such as BP PLC and Royal Dutch Shell PLC have embarked on bold strategies to remake their business as regulatory and investor pressure to reduce carbon emissions mounts. Both have said they will invest heavily in renewable energy—a strategy that their investors so far haven’t rewarded.\n\nExxon and Chevron haven’t invested substantially in renewables, instead choosing to double down on oil and gas. Both companies have argued that the world will need vast amounts of fossil fuels for decades to come, and that they can capitalize on current underinvestment in oil production.\n\nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/exxon-chevron-ceos-discussed-merger-11612126203?mod=hp_lead_pos1",
