        "content": "Index funds are the safe and easy way to invest your money, but shouldn’t we talk about stocks in r/stocks and not just vti, spy and qqq. Sure no one knows for sure which way a stock is going to go, but we can speculate and have the odds on our favor. r/stocks isn’t for the people who want to throw $1000 away each month and never think about it. r/investing should be for that stuff. We’re here to try and make money. Now I’m not saying that index funds are bad; if a person comes here saying \"I just got x dollars, what should I do with it?\" Telling them to put it in vti or spy is fine. We just shouldn’t be making posts about why spy and vti will be the winner in the long run. Half of the capital in the s&p500 is beating the market, and half is losing. We should be able to at least get decently accurate as to who will end up on which side.\n\nIn short, we should do more talking about stocks than index funds here in r/stocks",
