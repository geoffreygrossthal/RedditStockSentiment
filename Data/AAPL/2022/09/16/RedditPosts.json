Click of a mouse (or phone). That’s it. And with it you can have a losing trade, a winning trade, or a spectacular trade.\n\nBut it seems like day trading by concept is easy. Market goes up and down throughout the day. Anybody can scalp it or follow a trend.\n\nBut it’s the psychology that makes the successful traders the 1-10%. It’s our own brain that makes us hold losing trade hoping for a reversal, FOMO playing a trade, chasing a trade, sizing too big, impatience, etc.\n\nSeems like to be a successful trader, you literally have to fight against your own biological instincts of chasing that dopamine high.",
