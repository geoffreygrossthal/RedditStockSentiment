        "content": "Let me start of by saying I love my iPhone, but Siri leaves so much to be desired. For a company that touts having polished products and services, Siri fails to meet that level, and it is embarrassing. Google Assistant and Alexa run laps around her. There’s so many issues, from basic voice recognition and understanding what I’m saying to it not being able to do even a third of what rival voice assistants can do. She does nothing particularly well. I find myself visibly frustrated with her screwing up  basic core commands or not understanding basic sentences. She can’t even execute core functions adequately. Today, I asked her to remind me to get a COVID booster Friday, and instead of putting a reminder down for that, she pulls up web results for COVID boosters. I had a Galaxy Note 9 for a while, and Google Assistant puts Siri to shame and it’s the one thing I do miss from my brief flirtation with android. \n\nApple needs to fix Siri. This is not a quality product and it honestly doesn’t meet Apple’s reputation of polish and quality. Siri sucks. Flat out. She does not meet the level of quality Apple has staked it’s reputation on. If this company is serious about making a play into the smart home with HomePod and other third party accessories that are being shipped with Siri, then Siri MUST be fixed, or Apple will fail in making itself a player in the smarthome arena. The fact that Siri was a pioneer in the Voice Assistant arena, and then was allowed to languish and be lapped by rivals is unacceptable.",
