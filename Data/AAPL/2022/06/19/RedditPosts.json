The likes that will never go away?**\n\nWhat comes to my mind are the likes of $KO, $BLK, $BRK.B, $JPM, and $T.\n\nConsistently delivering dividends would be a great +. \n\nRight now I have been focusing on Norwegian stocks, and so far I am around +350% up this year since I hit the jackpot with Solstad Offshore (ticker SOFF on the OBX exchange) and the energy stocks here have been booming.\n\nBut now feel like exploring the US market. As of today, I only have Apple (AAPL) and Lithium Americas ($LAC), not more than 1500$ invested in total - just to get a taste. \n\nAny suggestions or discussion would be greatly appreciated! \n\n**Disclaimer: I know do not know s\\*\\*\\* about f\\*\\*\\* about the US market, hence my question here.**",
