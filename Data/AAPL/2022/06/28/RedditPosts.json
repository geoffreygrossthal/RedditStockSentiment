        "content": "I knew of two people who already attempted suicide from this bear market. everywhere I go I see people people who last posted on twitter/finviz/here/anecdotally in March or may saying they were going to kill themselves. in a certain discord there's been a user who amassed a lot of capital gains in crypto and penny stocks back in 2021 due to getting around 1.5 MM, which he had to pay off during this drawdown, meaning he cannot DCA or \"buy the dip\". the payment plan was 6k a month for a good 3 or 5 years.\n\nOnce this drawdown started, he put his entire net worth into more and more increasingly risky picks to try to break even, since he believed in David hunter's \"melt up\". eventually he was stuck with his entire net worth into TQQQ, trying desperately to just \"break even and get out of this scam system\". every day this user was having a mental breakdown. \n\nrecently he said he was buying more TQQQ on margin. he said if QQQ went down by 2%, he'd be entirely liquidated. he said he didn't care because he'd kill himself. the entire discord went into a group call with him and tried to convince him to sell instantly at market open since this was a dead cat bounce but this user insisted it was the bottom and that \"we are off to ATH by EOY like David hunter says\". \n\ntoday, QQQ fell by that dreaded amount and more. he posted saying he didn't sell because he thought the gap up today in the early morning was continuing. he said he's gonna do it tonight since QQQ is most likely staying down. \n\nWTF do I do??? everybody's dropping dead man!!",
