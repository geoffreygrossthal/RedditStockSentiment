        "content": "As Jim Kramer says these tech sell-offs usually last 3-4 days and no longer and wash out the weak hands and short-term momentum traders. 173 seems to be the short term bottom and maybe the bottom for the future as well. That is not bad at all.  If it dips again, well then 168 held during the last sell-off so that is probably as low as she will go. \n\nI already see beaten down high-fliers start to rebound sharply so AAPL will likely go up tomorrow.  Nothing to worry about, but if you want AAPl shares it id a good day to buy. I remain 100% bullish and also let's be real, a small interest rate hike isn't going to put a single blemish on Apple.  For one thing, Apple has so much money it acts as a kind of bank itself loaning out corporate bond money all over the place. PLus wth inflation Apple also has pricing power. They could raise the price of an iPhone $100 and no one would care.",
