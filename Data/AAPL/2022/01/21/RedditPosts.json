        "content": "He didn't specifiy AAPL. VIAC was the only one he mentioned by name as a clear buy (down 5% on Netflix's woes but Paramount Plus, HBO Plus etc are the source of Netflix's woes, taking audience share).  INTC CEO also did a piece on CNBC sounding very convincing about the viability of modest PE legacy tech giants like itself and AAPL.   \n\nWe could also see a bargain basement shopping spree for buyers of companies like Apple.  If they want Peloton for instance, they can now buy it for 50% off.  So we shall see if Apple goes shopping or just continues buying back its own stock as they have been doing.  In fact I bet Apple buys back billions in AAPl share today.",
