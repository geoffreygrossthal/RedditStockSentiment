        "content": "AAPL is my favorite **defensive** stock for growth.  Since 2011 they have grown market share in PC sales (laptops & desktops) from 10.5% to 13+% while maintaining their premium pricing model IN SPITE of Intel and MSFT's Windows 10/Windows 11 efforts.  \n\n(link:) [https://www.statista.com/statistics/576473/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipment-share-apple/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/576473/united-states-quarterly-pc-shipment-share-apple/)\n\nYup, iPhones are their biggest moneymaker, but Macs and services (Apple TV, App Store, Apple Music etc) and \"other\" (Apple watch, Beats headphones, AirPods, plus whatever else they're working on).\n\nSo even if the market dips, my wager is that AAPL will dip LESS that the average tech stock.  They understand how to nurture R&D and flow it into products.  While Cook may be a less charismatic company manager than Jobs, he has done a good job of infusing growth into the corporate R&D and engineering culture.\n\nI encourage discussion.",
