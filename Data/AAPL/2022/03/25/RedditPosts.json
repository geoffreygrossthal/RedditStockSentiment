        "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI've been keeping track of AAPL for a little while as we all have. If you look at $AAPL 4H/6M chart, the overall trend has been bearish and I've been swinging. Currently, It's broken out of the bearish trend in a manner that now I'm predicting a bullish trend. Nevertheless, I got out \\~172 for risk management.\n\nWhat is everyone's prediction on AAPL with the trend break and what is the new PT for us?\n\nThanks in advance guys, let's chat!",
