        "content": "Shares of Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) jumped 2.97% in after-hours trading on Thursday after the technology giant posted positive financial earnings.\n\nFinancials: Apple reported earnings of $1.20 per share and revenue of $83 billion; both were better than expected.\n\nThe Good: The company’s iPhone revenue totaled $40.67 billion, which was better than expected. Overall, the company posted a June quarter record revenue.\n\nThe Bad: Services revenue was $19.6 billion, which was below estimates. And revenue for Mac decreased by $1 billion year-over-year.\n\nLet’s Cook: In an interview, Apple CEO Tim Cook said there were some challenges, including supply constraints and shutdowns in China, but Cook anticipates revenue accelerating and sees no “macroeconomic effect” on iPhone sales.\n\nFinal Thoughts: Apple is down 13% this year, which is better than most tech stocks. Despite problems, the company found a way to have a good quarter.\n\nHope you enjoyed this commentary.
