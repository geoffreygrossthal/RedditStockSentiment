        "content": "FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai is advancing a plan to kill net neutrality and let ISPs like Comcast and Verizon slow down or censor websites and apps. His plan would make the Internet slower and more expensive, and it would make censorship for profit the norm. \n \nWe can stop this like we stopped SOPA, TPP, and ACTA. We just need to make it clear that Pai’s plan is **toxic** so that no one in Washington wants anything to do with it. \n \nHere’s what we can do. There are 8 members of Congress currently egging the FCC on and helping Pai gut net neutrality. They recently put their names on a [statement of support](https://energycommerce.house.gov/news-center/press-releases/bicameral-leaders-comment-pai-s-internet-regulations-announcement) or expressed their support in a [document of anti-net neutrality talking points](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3728775-GOP-Member-Toolkit-FCC-Open-Internet-Order-5-2017.html) to show that Pai has some congressional backing.  \n \nThey’re hoping we don’t notice and that they won’t face a backlash, so we need to call out these members of Congress now to make sure other members of Congress stay away. That way we can starve Pai of the congressional backing he needs to push through his plan.\n \nHere are the 8 members of Congress that are publicly supporting Pai’s attack on net neutrality:\n \n* Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR)  (Twitter: [@RepGregWalden](https://twitter.com/repgregwalden); phone: 202-225-6730)\n* Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN)  (Twitter: [@MarshaBlackburn](https://twitter.com/MarshaBlackburn); phone: 202-225-2811)\n* Sen. John Thune (R-SD)  (Twitter: [@johnthune](https://twitter.com/johnthune); phone: 202-224-2321)\n* Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS)  (Twitter: [@RogerWicker](https://twitter.com/rogerwicker); phone: 202-224-6253)\n* Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) (Twitter: [@SpeakerRyan](https://twitter.com/speakerryan); phone: 202-225-3031)\n* Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA)  (Twitter: [@CathyMcMorris](https://twitter.com/cathymcmorris); phone: 202-225-2006)\n* Rep. Tom Graves (R-GA)  (Twitter: [@RepTomGraves](https://twitter.com/reptomgraves); phone: 202-225-5211)\n* Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH)  (Twitter: [@BobLatta](https://twitter.com/boblatta); phone: 202-225-6405)\n \nAll of these representatives and senators voted for the recent broadband privacy repeal bill as well. (Note: Paul Ryan did not formally vote on the broadband privacy bill because, by custom, the Speaker of the House does not vote on legislation unless their vote would be decisive. But, as Speaker, Ryan was responsible for bringing the bill to the floor to be voted on.)\n \n**Call their offices, tweet at them, post on their Facebook walls. Tell them you are appalled by their support for Ajit Pai’s plan to kill net neutrality and that you will do everything in your power to hold them accountable for destroying the Internet.** \n \nWe can’t let these members of Congress get away with supporting Pai’s plan, or else other members of Congress will think it’s safe to support it as well. We know the cable lobbyists are trying their best to get everyone in Congress to support Pai’s plan. It’s up to us to stand up and make them think twice before they mess with the Internet.\n\nEDIT: [u/pperca rightly points out](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/6e8wta/eight_members_of_congress_that_voted_to_kill/di8hxda/) that another 8 senators have co-sponsored a bill that would repeal net neutrality. While their bill isn’t an explicit endorsement of Pai’s plan at the FCC, it’s basically a thinly veiled way of supporting Pai, so they deserve to be called out too. \n \n* Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) (Twitter: [@SenMikeLee](https://twitter.com/SenMikeLee); phone:202-224-5444)\n* Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) (Twitter: [@JohnCornyn](https://twitter.com/JohnCornyn); phone:202-224-2934)\n* Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR)  (Twitter: [@TomCottonAR](https://twitter.com/TomCottonAR); phone:202-224-2353)\n* Ted Cruz (R-TX)  (Twitter: [@SenTedCruz](https://twitter.com/SenTedCruz); phone:202-224-5922)\n* Ron Johnson (R-WI)  (Twitter: [@SenRonJohnson](https://twitter.com/SenRonJohnson); phone:202-224-5323)\n* Rand Paul (R-KY)  (Twitter: [@RandPaul](https://twitter.com/RandPaul); phone:202-224-4343)\n* Thom Tillis (R-NC)  (Twitter: [@SenThomTillis](https://twitter.com/SenThomTillis); phone:202-224-6342)\n* Ben Sasse (R-NE)  (Twitter: [@SenSasse](https://twitter.com/SenSasse); phone:202-224-4224)\n* James Inhofe (R-OK)  (Twitter: [@JimInhofe](https://twitter.com/JimInhofe); phone:202-224-4721)\n\nEDIT 2: If you want to submit a comment to the FCC in support of net neutrality, and contact your lawmakers at the same time, you can use this site: [https://www.battleforthenet.com/](https://www.battleforthenet.com/)",
