I just threw away another beautiful box and I’m just tired of such waste just for a brief sensory unboxing experience. Maybe let’s request an option? I bet we could start a movement with this. Let me know what you all think \n\nDear Apple,\n\nWe love your design and appreciate the care, attention, and time that goes into designing your packaging. It is an orchestra of sensory experience and is forever tied to the Apple brand. \n\nBUT, at the end of the day, we  pay extra for that beautiful packaging that most of us “recycle” after taking out our shiny new device.  \n\nA proposal: give Us an option of: fancy packaging -OR- green/minimal packaging (or even the option to give the packaging right back to you to reuse for someone else). What do you say? #GreenApple\n\nSincerely,\nUs",
