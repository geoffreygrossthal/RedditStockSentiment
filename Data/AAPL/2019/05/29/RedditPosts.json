        "content": "Yesterday afternoon my MacBook Pro exploded during normal use. It was on my lap, plugged in, and suddenly started to spew smoke out both sides. I quickly placed it on the floor where it popped, the smoke increased, and it caught fire. Toxic smelling smoke filled my house triggering smoke and CO alarms. No one was injured, thankfully, but there was some damage to my home. The situation could have been much worse - imagine if I had been on a plane.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI went inside and was able to remove the computer to the porch using gloves (it was scalding hot). Below is a short video taken when I re-entered the house a few minutes after the explosion. After it cooled for an hour or so, I took it to the local Apple store in a rage. They understood the severity of the situation but said nothing could be done until it spent 24 hours in a fire-proof safe and that they'd call me with a plan/update.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey did not call. I reached out today and was told it had been \"escalated\" and I should hear something within FIVE days. I produce music for a living - FIVE days without my computer is unacceptable. It seemed like a worthwhile piece of information to share with the world, so there you have it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: the explosion was yesterday afternoon. earlier version said \"this afternoon\" and had people confused about timeline. apologies.\n\nEDIT: For those speculating that my music caused the explosion, you can listen here: https://open.spotify.com/artist/1mOUOvOOaoTF2b3kDjrety?si=ivcbXEKVTj6qn4hPPLvBdw\n\nhttps://reddit.com/link/bulbhv/video/qxi86sk0a8131/player",
