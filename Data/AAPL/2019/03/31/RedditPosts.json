I use it more often than I can possibly imagine for everything from simple tasks like adding some text into a pdf or covering up a small blemish in a picture to consolidating a mass-set of images into a single set. \n\nI think it gets glossed over when people consider the reasons to buy a Macbook or iMac but it really changes the game for me when I want to make a small edit but don't want to fire up Photoshop or some other expensive and power-hungry program.",
