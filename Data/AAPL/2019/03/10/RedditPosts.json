        "content": "I was at a friends house and was staying over after some drinks, I asked her for the WiFi password but she did not have it as her brother changed the password and she couldn't remember what it was set to. He was away for the weekend with no reception so she could not ask for it either.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told her not to worry and to look at her phone, I clicked on the SSID to join and boom, it appears on her phone asking to share passwords. It makes life so much easier and despite iOS having some flaws, this is one of the many reasons iOS is so great.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo all the people asking how this works or how to do it, here is a video.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/rzOi5zE](https://imgur.com/a/rzOi5zE)\n\nedit: Misspelled iOS and triggered someone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit 2: Whilst recording I messed the video up so took a few takes, the devices stopped bringing up the share password menu. Locking both devices and starting again fixed it.",
