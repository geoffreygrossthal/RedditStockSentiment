        "content": "I have an iPhone X. Very nice looking phone. My previous phone was a 6 Plus. The X is an amazing phone, the screen blows me away. But after over a year of use I still miss TouchID.\n\nTouchID was so easy and worked 99% of the time for me. So easy to unlock with one hand. Unlock without looking. Unlock at weird angles. \n\nFor me FaceID is way more work and much more inconvenent and slower. It requires my attention. And does not work in many situations when the phone isn't upright.\n\nFor example my car has car play. And some times it requires me to unlock the phone. But the phone does not have a direct view of my face where it is docked. So I have to enter the passcode. What a pain. \n\nAm I the only one?\n\n",
