        "content": "I get it, the new iPhones don't have 3D touch. But I use 3D touch on my iPhone XS very frequently and after updating to iOS 13 half of the functionality is suddenly gone. No more peek & pop in Safari, no more pressing on a song in Apple Music and depressing when holding my finger on \"Play next\" and many more... These were all useful functions I loved, and now they are not as functional as they were yesterday!\n\nMy phone is now less functional because it should not have anything that the newest and the greatest doesn't have. Don't get me wrong, I think the iPhone 11 is a cool device, but this is honestly not fair.",
