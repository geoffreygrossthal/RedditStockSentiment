One of the ways they (and google) harvest data is by giving people the ability to login to websites using their f/g account. Those websites do this to harvest more data for their nefarious purposes. ([don’t do this, btw](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/technology/personaltech/facebook-log-in-hack.html))\n\nThis seems like an opportunity for Apple to create a relatively simple tool that could serve the same function but not collect the data. It would be a great shot across the bow  to these companies, and providing a service without the downsides. I think It would make people more trusting of Apple. \n\nWhat do you all think?",
