        "content": "So I decided to tune in on Samsungs new Note 10 launch. I won't lie I was super salty when I saw Samsung base storage is 256GB with the note 10 at $950. Kinda feels bad considering I paid $999 for my XS with 64GB. I am hoping Apple bumps their base storages across all their products.\n\nEdit: Okay RIP my inbox, did not expect this to make it to the front page. But I'm glad the general consensus is 64GB on a $1000 phone and 128GB (non-upgradable) on a $1200 laptop is not enough. Overtime everything is starting to take more storage so it'd be nice for Apple to step it up and give us a little more for our money.",
