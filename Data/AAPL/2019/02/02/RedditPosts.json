        "content": "So I had the Anti-reflective coating issue on my 2015 15 inch MacBook Pro. I had the display replaced 2 times because of the extended 4 year program. It finally happened for a 3rd time. I spoke to a senior rep over the phone about replacing the whole unit...he agreed to give me a replacement laptop of the same value. So I scored a 2018 MacBook Pro 15 inch! So excited to have this beast!! \n\nEdit: A lot of people are saying negative things about the 2018 MacBook Pro. I’m not complaining. As a college student this is an amazing upgrade. I’m a professional photographer and the processing power is insane. \n\nEdit 2: Here is more information about the display replacement program [Staingate](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/11/17/apple-extends-free-staingate-repairs/amp/)",
