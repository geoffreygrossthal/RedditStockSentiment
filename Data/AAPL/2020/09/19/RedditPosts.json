As of last Saturday, disconnects were running at nearly 8x the daily levels observed in August ‚Äî a multi-year high, YipitData added.\n\nStill, despite the downbeat data, the cancellations should not have much of a lasting impact on Netflix‚Äôs overall subscriber base. The platform has well over 182 million users worldwide and is the clear leader in the competitive streaming space ‚Äî regardless of its recent controversies.\n\nThanks for the awards.",
