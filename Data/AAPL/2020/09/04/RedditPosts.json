Making room for them are three names heading down to the MidCap 400: H&R Block (NYSE:HRB), Coty (NYSE:COTY) and Kohl's (NYSE:KSS). ETSY is +5.4% postmarket; TER +3.1%; COTY +0.8%; KSS +0.5%.\n\n>Making a market-cap move up to the MidCap 400 are SmallCap 600 constituents Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING), Medpace Holdings (NASDAQ:MEDP) and Fox Factory Holding (NASDAQ:FOXF). They're replacing PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF), Allegheny Technologies (NYSE:ATI) and Mack-Cali Realty (NYSE:CLI), all of which head down to the SmallCap 600. After hours: WING -0.9%; PBF +0.8%; ATI +3.5%.\n\n>Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:JAZZ) is also joining the MidCap 400, replacing Transocean (NYSE:RIG), which is no longer representative of the space. After hours: JAZZ +4.8%; RIG -0.8%.\n\n>And Mr. Cooper Group (NASDAQ:COOP) and R1 RCM (NASDAQ:RCM) are joining the SmallCap 600, replacing Express (NYSE:EXPR) and Pennsylvania Real Estate (NYSE:PEI).

        "content": "Long term investor speaking. \n\n5 years ago in a famous today TED Talk he predicted that we will suffer a world-wide pandemic. Right now he sits while smiling at camera and telling the broad audience that in the next 10 years we will suffer an enviromental crisis. My question is how are you buckling up for that? \n\nTech stocks are one thing, large companies like Apple are trying to reduce their carbon footprint, TESLA is another good stake future wise. \n\nDo we invest into biotech, solar tech or companies like impossible meat? I don't want to sit with my hand in the toilet becase I bought OIL stocks instead of that one small company that tried to turn leafs into drinkable water. \n\nCheers",
