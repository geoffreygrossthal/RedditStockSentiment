        "content": "So, here I made a losing trade just moments ago. My stop was triggered while I was having breakfast. I didn't look at my phone twice nor did I complaine or rant about it. It's not hurting like it used to 5 years ago when I set feet in this path; as a matter of fact when I saw my stop order trigger earlier, it didn't even interrupt my breakfast. Why am I telling you this? Because this kind of attitude is what I've been training myself for and you should be as well. I see people here posting rants and complaints to show their anger and despair when they're losing and celebrating when they win. A professional just don't do that. They just don't. If you're one of those who celebrate the winnings (myself included months ago) that just shows how much you still have to learn! Doing that is like seeing a dentist celebrate after filling a cavity or a meth cheff celebrating a high-purity yield on a batch that they just cooked. You get it right? So, focus on execution and don't get too emotional, is the moral of the post!",
