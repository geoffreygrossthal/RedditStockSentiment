        "content": "MagSafe was originally designed for laptops so that if someone tripped on the power cable, the cable would detach safely and not pull the laptop down with it. \n\nIf someone trips on the new iPhone 12 MagSafe cable, it’s going to bring the phone down with it. Also the MagSafe cable is too short to be able to use the phone comfortably while it’s connected. \n\nStick to a regular Qi charger if you want wireless charging, people.",
