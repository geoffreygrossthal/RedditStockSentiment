        "content": "I sold. I put my life saving of 56k into spirit RCL, CCL, and Sixflags. I cashed out at $120k. I couldn’t take it any more. I bought bitcoin in 2017 and it went 4x and I held. I went from 65k to what is worth 15k now. This feels like 2017 bitcoin. These numbers don’t add up to the value of the stocks I held and am happy with my profit. Even finally showed my wife the portfolio balance. I did put everything into JNJ, AMD, AAPL and MSFT. \n\nIf my travel stocks double next month I will be happy selling at a profit. I wish you all great success in your picks!",
