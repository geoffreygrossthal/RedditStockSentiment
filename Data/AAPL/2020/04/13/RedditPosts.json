        "content": "Hi All,\n\nLike many other investors, I rapidly became overwhelmed with the uncertainty in the future. Consequently I decided to focus in on what we know now with high probability. Essentially this is assuming all fiscal / monetary policies as currently enacted and consensus estimates on COVID-19 mitigation (i.e. gradual resumption of normal commerce after mid to late Q2). See more detailed assumptions later. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nSome facts going into the analysis:\n\n* 2019 saw a ~30% gain in the S&P 500, however corporate earnings were nearly flat. Consequently, the 30% rise in the S&P 500 was due almost entirely to increases in valuation, i.e. stock investors paying more for future earnings\n* The OECD had projected in September 2019 3.0% Global GDP growth and 2.0% for the US. This was already a deceleration of global growth from 3.6% worldwide in 2018 and 2.9% in the US.\n* US Manufacturing, according to the ISM and IHS Markit surveys, weakened through most of 2019 (although showed a slight rebound near the end of year)\n* US Business investment also declined through much of 2019, potentially due to the \"trade war\" between the China & the US\n* US Consumer spending remained robust throughout 2019, although also appeared to decelerate near the end of 2019 / early 2020. \n* US households had modestly de-leveraged as a % of GDP since 2008, and the debt servicing costs (due to lower interest rates) were at historic lows at the end of 2019. It’s worth noting the changing composition of household debt, with strong increases in student loan and auto debt while mortgage debt decreased. Housing debt peaked at ~$10 trillion in 2008, compared to slightly less than ~$10 trillion at the end of 2019. However, non-housing debt peaked at ~$2.7 trillion in 2008, while by 2019 non-housing debt stood at $4.2 trillion\n* US Corporate debt stood at record levels as compared to GDP: ~75%. This debt had also deteriorated in ratings with the largest percentage in history rated as slightly above junk (BBB)\n* The US deficit for fiscal year 2019 was estimated at ~$1 trillion pre-COVID\n* The bulk of net inflows from 2016-2019 into US equities have been driven by stock buybacks. Since 2009, companies have spent ~$5 trillion in share buybacks\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nIn short, my analysis is that the US economy entered 2020 with modest to low growth prospects. While consumer spending and household debt servicing costs remained bright spots, modest wage gains coupled with high housing, education, and healthcare costs presented a mixed picture. Both business investment and manufacturing activity were subdued, although hopes for a \"Phase 1\" trade war seemed cause for modest optimism. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWith those facts as background, here are my baked in assumptions for the following analysis:\n\n* The OECD nations + major developing countries (China, etc.) modestly resume normal economic activity in mid to late Q2\n\n* There is no vaccine or \"miracle drug\" until late 2020 / 2021\n* Stimulus from major central banks globally prevents an immediate financial crisis or severe market distortions (e.g. the corporate credit market seizing up)\n* Additional fiscal stimulus measures, while substantial, do not exceed the original stimulus bills (e.g. the $2.2 trillion US bill)\n* The COVID-19 lockdown contributes to a severe recession in Q1/Q2 2020 in most countries, but the easing of lockdown measures + stimulus leads to modest to substantial recovery in Q3 2020. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAlright, onto the main event. Here is what I think is \"baked\" into the future assuming the above events:\n\n* Dramatic increases in sovereign debt levels. The US alone is estimated to run a deficit of ~$3-4 trillion depending on the severity and duration of the recession. With global debt levels already at records highs, it is unclear what effect these substantial debt levels will have (deflation, inflation, stagflation, no effect?) \n\n* Severe budget deficits in US state & local governments. Increased spending on unemployment insurance and healthcare expenditures coupled with decreased revenues will force states to significantly cut their budgets. These cuts will include layoffs of non-essential employees. \n* Increased pressure on Euro zone economies, particularly Italy. Italian economic growth remained anemic in 2019 at 0.3%. With the complete lockdown of the Italian economy (which began in the economic engine of Northern Italy), Italy will likely face dramatic declines in GDP and correspondingly large government deficits. Northern Eurozone countries will be faced yet again with difficult choices with regards to Italian debt. Pressure from northern Eurozone countries on Italy risk furthering inflaming public opinion and leading to a separatist backlash. \n* Negative to zero growth in US consumer spending in 2020. Despite the enhanced unemployment insurance, stimulus checks, and corporate / small biz loans I believe it is unlikely that consumer spending will rebound in 2020. Consumers will prioritize on paying off debts, rebuilding savings, etc. due to the economic uncertainty. Furthermore there is permanent demand destruction in certain sectors, e.g. consumers are unlikely to replace all of their canceled vacations, restaurant visits, shopping excursions, etc. The \"wealth effect\" will work in reverse as many high income households see drops in both their investments accounts as well as variable compensation: bonuses, pay raises, RSUs, stock options, etc. \n* Unemployment will remain substantially elevated over its early 2020 low of ~3.5% through 2020. As in 2009, many corporations will \"do more with less\" in lieu of hiring during uncertain times. Small and medium sized businesses will face substantial revenue losses in 2020 and will focus on cutting costs to remain solvent. \n* Manufacturing and business investment will remain weak in 2020. Manufacturing will continue to stagnant due to sluggish demand for automobiles, aircraft, and other durable goods. Businesses will focus on preserving cash, paying down / refinancing debts, etc. due to weak global demand\n* The US Federal Reserve will continue to support markets with QE and other monetary policy measures. \n* Increased likelihood of a change in US presidential administrations. In early 2020 the Democratic party appeared poised to nominate a progressive, divisive candidate in Bernie Sanders. By April 2020 Joe Biden, a center-left candidate, had secured the nomination. At the same time, the US economic outlook had substantially deteriorated. While the economy is likely to improve in the June-November timeline, it is unclear if this recovery will be substantial enough to allow President Trump to run on a message of economic recovery. The increased likelihood of a Democratic presidential administration is a corresponding decreased likelihood of further US corporate tax cuts.\n* Dramatic decrease in stock buybacks in 2020. Companies will focus on preserving cash and reducing debt levels. \n* Significant deployment of \"dry powder\" from cash rich corporates and private equity firms (which have ~$2+ trillion in unallocated funds). These funds will look for opportunities in distressed credit, M&A, and other opportunistic areas\n* Continued low oil prices in 2020. While a modest recovery is possible, the magnitude of demand destruction for oil, the unraveling of Opec+, and the continuing impact of American shale drillers will contain price growth. \n* Continued China - US tension. There is little sign of a thaw in relations, and a hard line against China is one of the few popular bi-partisan issues in US domestic politics. Initial discussions to suspend Chinese tariffs during the crisis seem to have stalled.\n* Emphasis on supply chain resiliency / diversification. Between the US - China trade war and the COVID-19 outbreak, OECD companies will face both investor and political pressure to diversify their supply chain away from China. This will bolster the slow and gradual shift that was already underway due to increasing Chinese labor costs and the perception of an opaque, unfair legal regime. In the short term this will drive up costs (China is a manufacturing hub for many reasons beyond cheap labor) which will either compress corporate profits or raise consumer prices.  \n* Unlike 2009, there does not appear to be a new global engine of growth. China seems justifiably concerned about exacerbating their debt situation with massive fiscal stimulus. India was already experiencing a recession, and other major economies like Nigeria, Indonesia, etc. do not have the per capita purchasing power to stimulate global growth. Many of these countries are also suffering from the collapse in commodity prices and the flight from emerging market bonds / equities. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI hesitate to forecast the future, because obviously there is significant uncertainty. However, my personal base case is that an immediate \"V-shaped\" recovery in asset prices is unlikely. For asset prices to reach or exceed 2020 levels would require corporates to either substantially increase earnings in mid to late 2020 AND investors to value future earnings at the same high levels of 2020. However, it is worth noting that the record low interest rates (and corresponding bond yields) and monetary easing could in theory drive investors into equities, real estates, private equity, etc. as the only option for positive returns. My personal base case is a sluggish recovery in mid to late 2020 with asset prices remaining volatile to shifts in sentiment. With the Fed stabilizing markets, a widespread global depression seems unlikely but could occur if high global debt levels trigger widespread corporate bankruptcies or some form of \"stagflation\". Another unlikely, but possible case is that the world emulates Japan after the early 1990s and experiences a long period of slow asset price decline as corporates deleverage, credit availability declines modestly, and no new global engines of growth emerge. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThoughts?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nEdit #2: Adding in how to know I'm wrong\n\n\nOne thing that occurred to me is that since this analysis is slightly bearish, I should proactively offer some data points that would indicate I'm wrong / overly pessimistic:\n\n* Rapid recovery in US consumer spending in Q3 / Q4 2020 to pre-COVID levels\n* Rapid return to pre-COVID employment, ~3.5%, by Q4 2020 \n* Increased US business investment / manufacturing activity in Q3 / Q4 to supplement or replace consumer spending\n* The rapid return of the US corporate debt market which enables large stock buybacks in Q4 2020 onward\n* Corporate earnings growth compared to late 2019 (i.e. not simply quarter on quarter comparisons against the likely awful Q1 / Q2 numbers)\n* Massive US government infrastructure projects / other stimulus programs that generate demand and boost US household incomes \n\nEdit #3: Some people have correctly pointed out that India was not in a recession in 2019. Apologies, I should have said that growth had decelerated over 2019, with Q4 2019 growth estimated at ~4.7% compared to GDP of ~7% in 2018. I think my larger point stands that India's economy did not appear to be trending in a positive direction, and given their per capita income of ~$1700 4.7% is not sufficient to dramatically improve global growth. \n\nSources:\n\n* https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2019/11/30/the-stock-markets-25-gain-is-totally-due-to-higher-valuations-and-not-earnings/#3a67eab022ba\n* https://www.oecd.org/economy/oecd-sees-rising-trade-tensions-and-policy-uncertainty-further-weakening-global-growth.htm\n* Business Investment: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/W790RC1Q027SBEA\n* Consumer spending: https://www.bea.gov/system/files/2020-03/pi0220_hist.pdf\n* US Debt: https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html\n* $400 expense: https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-06-04/the-400-emergency-expense-story-is-wrong\n* Corporate Debt: https://www.blackrock.com/institutions/en-us/insights/investment-actions/assessing-risks-in-bbb-corporate-bonds\n* Corporate Deb #2: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-13/for-battered-junk-bond-market-an-old-risk-grows-louder-each-day\n* Stock buybacks: https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/29/goldman-says-there-are-three-big-stock-buyers-that-will-keep-the-record-rally-going.html\n* India Growth: https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/moodys-cuts-indias-gdp-growth-forecast-to-5-6-for-2019/articleshow/72520706.cms?from=mdr\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit: My first gold and silver, thank you kind strangers!",

        "score": 1796,
        "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/g0o33t/you_asked_me_to_look_into_the_renewable_energy/",
        "content": "After my last post, I had multiple people asking if I could take a deeper look into the renewable energy industry. Since I’m also very interested and I feel it will become a very important sector, I took the time to review it. First of all, let me explain why investing now is a good time. \n\nWhen you look at manufacturers, the biggest market cap is not even $5 billion. There is so much room for growth and there’s also a lot of competition. When you can point your finger at the best company, it might be the homerun for your portfolio in 10-15 years. Even if you don’t hit the right one, it’s still gonna be ok since the industry is only growing. To be clear, I only looked at manufacturers, not distributors. You won’t see any companies like NEE, DUK, BEP, etc. \n\nSecondly, you all know Trump doesn’t believe in environmentally issues, renewable energy and that sort of stuff. With elections coming up, investments might stay the same or they might go up drastically when the democrats win. Either way, the sector will continue to grow and you can’t really go bad with investing in it. \n\nLast argument, I feel like a lot of people don’t know the importance of solar energy yet. It goes beyond the industry, as it gets implemented more and more by other industries. It’s already a big item for giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon,… to keep their cloud servers running for example. \n\n— — — — — — — — — —\n\nIn this post, I will focus on solar energy the most, as it is the biggest and most important part of renewable energy. Based on market cap from the solar industry, we have 3 leaders and 7 others on a significant distance, but still able to get to the top for the next 5-10 years. From that top 10, RUN, SPWR and VSLR fall off based on financials.  \n\n**ENPH**  \nMarket leader on micro-inverters (the things that convert solar charge into electricity). Even their inverters get used by big competitors like SPWR. Investing more and more into energy storage. It’s focussing on the private market, which might be a short term problem, but their inverters are definitely their big win. Not only do they receive revenue from their own installations, but they have other companies using their products as well when installing other products, making ENPH techniques present in an enormous amount of solar installations. The financials are great, they have a decent amount of cash to get investing and they’re only profitable since last year, giving them a lot of room to grow. They’re bound to get number one position in solar tech and they didn’t even launch their best technology yet. \n\n**SEDG**  \nGreat financials as well. Assets over double amount of liabilities, almost no long term debt and enough cash to get growing. Very big growth on revenue. They were planning to even double their production in 2020 and release some new products, but that’s gonna be delayed a bit. They are working with TSLA on batteries and charging stations. It all looks very positive, although I have to point out some people are calling SEDG ‘yesterday’s solution’. It might be up and keep growing a lot, but if you want the best 10 year investment, you should stick with ENPH. \n\n**FSLR**  \nVery inconsistent income, but a great balance sheet. Assets 3 times liabilities and loads of cash to get investing into the future. Their profit margins are pretty small though, in comparison to the industry. FSLR is the only company that works with utility companies to provide energy. To draw you a simple picture: if you get electric energy at home, it’s been delivered by utility companies and the energy itself is mostly created by FSLR. Over the past few years, utilities are losing market share because people are buying and setting up their own energy installations at home. Therefore utilities, and by extension FSLR, are losing market share. Because of the crisis, people will be less likely to install their own installations as unemployment numbers are rising. FSLR could be the better short term bet, but it’s hard to predict when it will turn around again and they will definitely lose long term. \n\n**JKS**  \nVery innovative techniques, one of the most efficient solar panels on the market. Therefore gaining a lot of advantage on their competitors, or ‘moat’ by Warren Buffett terms. If you feel like solar panels are the most important part of the industry, I would definitely suggest looking into JinkoSolar. They have a lot of cash to get investing, low on long term debt and I see them coming the closest to top 3 in the future.\n\n**CSIQ**  \nLooking for value, then this is the one. PEG ratio of only 0.19, the industrial average is 0.68. Have to point out as well that their growth rate isn’t that great and you might wait a long long time to get the gains going on this one. They also have a lawsuit running against them, claiming to steal Solaria’s patented module technology. \n\n**NOVA**  \nThey might get hit hard by covid-19. Sunnova is a pretty young company, full on investing and expanding, thus having low cash reserves. They might need to be backed by bailout money, putting them even further behind the top 5 solar companies. When they get back in 1-2 years, I feel like the other companies will have too much of a head start. \n\n**AZRE**  \nThey have experienced almost no impact from covid-19 as an Indian based company. Their projects have not been impacted and the plants are running full force. However there has been significant reduction in demand and they’ve been seeing delayed payments from customers. It operates like First Solar, selling energy to government utilities. Big profit margins as well, so they might get out of this crisis easily. That’s also the main reason why the stock didn’t drop that much. Growth will be limited, but a stable investment. \n\n— — — — — — — — — —\n\nNext, I’m gonna mention some other renewable energy resources. I took one of the best companies per industry as an example, but I’m not gonna go through those resources more deeply as I don’t believe in them.\n\n**VWDRY**  \nThe wind energy industry is more inconsistent than solar energy, therefore not the most favorable kind of resource to invest in. It also doesn’t have real potential to expand to private use, but whoever wants to invest in it, I suggest VWDRY. It is the biggest company in the world in terms of wind power. Apart from having the most and biggest wind farms, they also offer their maintenance and knowledge to help optimizing other wind farm locations. Vestas also just signed a great contract with a Danish energy company for delivery in the upcoming next years. They have a lot of cash ready to invest and they also have decent value, so you can’t really go wrong with them.\n\n**REGI**  \nREGI produces and sells biofuels and renewable chemicals. It produces biomass-based diesel, using corn oil, used cooking oil and inedible animal fat amongst other things. The company might be in bad weather, as they are low on cash. They are operating in an investment needing industry, so it’s definitely not the right moment for a financial crisis like this.\n\nAs you can see, I didn’t include nuclear energy companies. Nuclear energy is a green energy solution and definitely isn’t bad. However it’s not growing like solar and wind because it has a lot of negative feedback and image. There is more waste, it’s more expensive and therefore also less investments. It’s easy math, the more volume, the lower price. No one is investing in nuclear, so pricing can’t compete with other resources. \n\n— — — — — — — — — —\n\nFor me, this research was surprising. I was expecting to find more small companies with breaking innovative techniques, but it seems like the ones at the top are predicted to stay there and increase distance. If anyone has some valuable information on small companies, definitely share them in this thread.\n\nTo conclude, ENPH and SEDG are without a doubt the best investments right now. Depending on your timeline, you might want to sell SEDG in 5-10 years, while keeping ENPH for a lifetime. JKS is the higher risk, higher reward kinda bet here, with still decent coverage of risk.\n\nThere are of course way more other renewable energy resources, but I don’t know enough about them. If I would start researching them, I might be working like a professional broker/investor and I decided that I’ve put enough energy into stock research the past weeks. Right now, I’m gonna enjoy the weather, work a bit in the garden and passively buy some shares this week with all that info I’ve gathered over the past few months.",
