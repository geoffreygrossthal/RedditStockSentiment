        "content": "I was at this Apple store in Fashion Square - Scottsdale with my friend checking out the new iPad Pro and the other products. \n\nWhile we were checking out the new iPad and the new pen, we faced a little problem making the pen work because it was not connected to the iPad, on the other side of the table was Adam, who is a customer service guy, he noticed that we had a problem so he came over and helped us out, he showed us how the pen works, how can I use it and how nice it is. He also showed us around the new iPad in great detail, he showed us the new typing cover and examined all angles of it. \n\n\nThat all sounds normal until you realize that he did all of that while being blind. I was so amazed and stunned by his work and by how accurate he was, he was pointing at everything and describing it like everything was normal and there is no problem at all. I have never seen this kind of customer service ever in my life and not in any retail store. I was really amazed, so I wanted to give him this shoutout.\n\n\nedit 1: I am going to send a letter/email to both Apple and the store\n\nUpdate: I chatted with Apple customer service on Twitter and they said that they will be sure that it gets to the right place.",
