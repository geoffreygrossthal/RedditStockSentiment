        "content": "My Apple Pencil 2 slipped from my hand and hit the floor tip first. I didn't think it was a problem till I tried writing some notes and I noticed it just straight wasn't writing. I looked at the tip and noticed it dented. I had figured that my $130 stylist could handle a 3ft fall but I guess not. It wasn't to much a problem I thought, there should be some extra tips in the box like the old one did. To my surprise all the box had was the pencil and some papers showing me how to charge it. Very classy apple. Charge me $30 more and don't even include pieces to make the product last longer \n\nUPDATE: Went to the Apple store today to resolve the issue and since I was in the return date they just exchanged it without any questions. Customer service is still top notch!",
