        "content": "There seems to be lots of examples of this going on at the moment: removing the 3.5mm/lightning adapter from the iPhones, dropping the replacement nib for the new Pencil, the crappy USB C cable provided with the new iPad Pros, that only supports USB 2 capabilities.\n\nThe worst one for me though is one that goes back a while, and it's the 5gb of cloud storage that they provide.\n\n5gb is a piss poor amount to start with, but the fact they only provide it once, regardless of how many devices you own, and what capacity those devices hold, is just being mean for the sake of it. And yeah, I know that you can buy extra storage, and it's pretty cheap (I paid for the 200gb option), but still - this isn't something that you should have to do.",
