Days after the aggressive iPhone XR for $449 ads, we now have a new iPhone Xs for $699 ad. \n\nApart from the fact that this is extremely deceptive marketing since the price of the phone remains the same without the trade in, it's very uncharacteristic of Apple. We expect Samsung and Xiaomi to resort to this kind of sales strategy. \n\nI guess Apple really overestimated customer loyalty when it comes to pricing.",
