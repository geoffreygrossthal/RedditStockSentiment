        "content": "Bug fixes, improvements, updates, etc. for iMessage and stock iPhone  apps are few and far in between.\n  \nIt would be great if Apple updated their stock apps via the App Store, the same way 3rd party devs update their apps. \n  \nApple currently does this with Pages, Keynote, GarageBand, etc., but they donâ€™t do it for stock iPhone apps.\n  \nInstead, users have to wait a year between major software updates to receive enhancements to the app everyone uses the most. \n  \nIt would be great if Apple regularly pushed out updates for iMessage and their stock iPhone apps, adding features, fixing bugs, and making their stock apps a constant work in progress. Waiting a whole year for new features/updates is getting a bit stale. ",
