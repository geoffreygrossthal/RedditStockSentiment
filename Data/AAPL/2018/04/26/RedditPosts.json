        "content": "Last week I went out and bought a spare charger for my laptop thinking “one day I’ll need this” and I was sick of carrying the one back and forth from work and getting under my desk everyday to plug it in. \n\nToday I was working late, laptop about to die right as I was finally figuring out the problem. So I got out the new charger from my bag, struggle to get it out of the box while laptop is at 1%, trying to hurry, then I realize the $85 charger doesn’t come with a cable. Just the square. I have 0 USB-C cables in the house. Having to drive an hour to work to get a cable the charger should’ve come with. A picture of the cable is even on the freaking box!\n\n/rant",
