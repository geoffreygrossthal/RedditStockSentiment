        "content": "I was downtown with my friends yesterday, when some mole pick pocket stole my wallet. I called my bank to have my card cancelled. The card was also registered to use apple pay on my iPhone. I was told that my new card will arrive in a few days. To my surprise, 15 minutes after it was cancelled, my new card was already automatically registered with Apple Pay, so I wasn't left moneyless in the middle of the city. \n\nThanks bank, and thanks Apple Pay.",
