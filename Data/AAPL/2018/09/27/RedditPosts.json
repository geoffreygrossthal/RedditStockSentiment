Saw the little Live Photo icon, and was moved to tears realizing that I had over 100 short clips of him. Most of them were crap photos, but upon clicking on them they really offer a glimpse back into a happier time. \n\nIt was something I never thought I would used, but they are now my most cherished photos in my library. \n\nI am seriously thinking about switching back to Iphone for this one stupid feature. \n\nI really really appreciate that they added it.  \n\nThanks Apple sincerely.
