        "content": "I woke up this morning for work and quickly checked the shipping status for my XS Max. ‘SHIPPING STATUS: DELAYED, SORTING ERROR’.  My phone had been shipped to the wrong local sorting office for my courier. They were useless on the phone, the wrong sorting office was about 60 miles away but due to the way they work, they would have to send the package back to the other end of the country and sort it again. I offered to pop over to the sorting facility and pick it up, nothing wrong with a Friday afternoon road trip... can’t do that either, against policy.\nI give Apple a call to see if there were any iPhones at my local store. They told me they have a ‘Plan B’ in place for this exact scenario. From what I gather Apple has booked out tons of same day courier resources to fix any of these issues. In 2 hours a same day courier was dispatched to grab my phone from the old couriers sorting facility and zipped over to me.\nWhen talking on the phone with the Apple rep I said that it really wasn’t going to be a big deal if the phone showed up tomorrow, but they said ‘you obviously put in an effort to make sure you got one of our devices on launch day, the least we can do is do right by you and get your device  to you on time.’  Blown away.\n\nTLDR: courier messed up my iPhone delivery, apple had a plan B that involved dedicated same day couriers from another company to fix it.",
