        "content": "I am getting annoyed seeing AutoModerator remove posts in /r/Apple all because the mods want to decrease the number of questions in this subreddit.\n\nIt's my opinion that people asking questions are part of what make this subreddit thrive. I have answered many questions, small and large, and people have done the same for me. Helping people is part of what makes the Apple community such a great place to be a part of, and we shouldnt be shutting questions down only to suggest they instead go someplace else where no one will help them.\n\nIf if users on this subreddit really don't like helping others, then /r/Apple needs to get on board with the Reddit redesign, [which is going to use flair like \"tags\" that can easily be enabled/disabled to see posts that match that content](https://redditblog.com/2017/11/08/an-update-on-reddits-redesign/).\n\nNo one uses /r/AppleWhatShouldIBuy or /r/AppleHelp and other subs that this AutoModerator recommends, so change the criteria. Because all i'm going to do otherwise is re-word the question to get around AutoModerator's aggressive behavior. And I recommend others do the same.\n\nThank you.",
