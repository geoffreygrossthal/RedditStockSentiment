        "content": "In my opinion TSM until 2023 is going to absolutely explode and dominate everything and one else in an unseen way. They will control the GPU and CPU markets in the desktop space (Nvidia Hopper is being made with them and Intel is rumored to go fabless in the next few years, they also manufacture all AMD products). They also control the console space with AMD so Xbox and Playstation and are manufacturing Apple's APU in their phone. I don't see how it doesn't become a 500-600$ stock in the coming years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you for the awards, great comments and don't forget to do your own DD before buying or selling anything, good luck.\n\n&#x200B;",
