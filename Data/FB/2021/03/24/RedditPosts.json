        "content": "For the past month I've been getting absolutely crushed little by little each day it seems like in every sector.  I feel like I have a pretty well diversified portfolio.  I'm not really heavy on any one particular stock out of the ones below, so I'm not even sure where the majority of the losses are coming from.  I'm still green on most everything but I've given back a lot of gains, these definitely aren't all my investments but a majority of the bigger positions.    \nTech/Growth:  AAPL, GOOG, PLTR, TSLA, AMZN, AMD, UBER, BABA, JD etc. \\~35%  \nTravel/Rebound (cyclical):  UAL, AAL, OXY, MGM, MAR, NCLH, TRIP, ABNB \\~30%  \nFinancials: WFC, BCS, JPM, BAC\\~10%  \nRetail stocks for stimulus check play:  UAA, NKE, M, LULU, etc.  \\~10%  \nOther positions making up less than 15%   \n\n\nSomehow I've lost about 20% of my portfolio with these names in the last month, it doesn't feel like it but every day it goes down 1 or 2% and that starts to add up.  I know I know, in 5 years who cares but I just wanted to know if other people seem to be in the same boat.  I haven't seen the main indexes see that kind of loss so I'm not getting where it seems to be coming from.  Even today when all looked great in the morning now somehow I'm deep red again (another 2%) despite indexes being mostly stable.",
