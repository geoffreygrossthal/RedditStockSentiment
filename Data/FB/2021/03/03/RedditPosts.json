        "content": "This meme stock explosion has made me even more tight and Scrooge-like with my money. I have most of money sitting in blue chip stocks like DIS & HSBC amongst many others with a small amount for playing, doing my own DD on and hoping for a 3x but settling for a small profit or loss in most cases. \n\nI love reading other people’s DD, always have, and it’s great to have a community that helps you cut down a bit of the work (even though you must follow up with your own reading) in potentially spotting something that could be big. However, there has been a massive spike recently of people that finish they DD with ‘this could be the next GME’ or something similar and as soon as I read that, I am instantly put off. \n\nEverything they have said up to that point gets a little tainted for me. \n\nI know this is completely irrational and actually a bit stupid on my part but I equate it to a restaurant that has ‘The Best (insert food item)‘ or ‘World Famous blah blah’ on their menu. It puts me off instantly. \n\nAnyone else feel like this? Or am I just being snooty?",
