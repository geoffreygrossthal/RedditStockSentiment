        "content": "As of writing this, TSLA has gone up another 14% today, bringing its one month gain to over 89%. This is crazy to me, but it's still pretty fun to watch it go up. I wouldn't be surprised if  TSLA hit $2000 this week if earnings are positive. Thoughts? Will TSLA ever go back down under $1000?\n\n(Edit: of course after posting this, the price fell and is now only up about 1% on the day) ",
