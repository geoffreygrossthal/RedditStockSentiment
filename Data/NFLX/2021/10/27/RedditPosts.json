        "content": "Yes, the title says it all. I firmly believe this market is incorrect on a lot of things. No, I am not saying I am shorting it. No, I am not saying if you’re investing you’re about to go through a massive correction. I will say this though…\n\nYesterday, Visa reported earnings that were a hit. They did great, EPS was way up, revenue was way up. Not only thing though, they are raising their dividend for their investors. They’ll be paying you even more for owning their shares because they have such great cash flow. The market opens today, they’re down over 5%. MA, which reports tomorrow morning, is down 6% with it. One could assume they’ll have pretty similar earnings and revenue. Maybe even up their dividend too (don’t hold your breath for that one, but who knows). But Tesla, a company who has sold patents, licensing, and Bitcoin to pad their balance sheet for specific quarters so that their earnings look better to the common shareholder, went up 12% because a company that was on the brink of  bankruptcy pulled a publicity stunt saying they’d buy 100K cars. \n\nThese are just examples of what is happening as a whole in our market. I’m buying these companies who are being screwed and I can tell you this, I am right and the market is wrong. I warn any investor who is partaking in this, because greed and speculation has run rampant while fundamentals and discipline has been thrown out the window. \n\nWatch.",
