Morgan analysts wrote in a note published Friday.\n\nAmazon's U.S. retail business is the \"fastest growing at scale,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nAfter 9 months of consolidation, amazon should be finally able to break out. AWS and advertising keep growing, and amazon shipping operation can now challenge UPS, Fedex and USPS. For e-commerce, it is still a leader that none of the any other company can match or catch up. For the past 2 weeks investors were slowly rotating back to the established growth big tech stocks, so amazon should be able to break ath this month.\n\nThanks for the awards.",
