        "content": "Today I sold almost all of my position in MSFT, which I've held since I was born. On my birth day, my grandparents bought a number of shares for me, which my parents told me about when I turned 18. \n\nThis is the second time I've sold any of it, the first time was when my dad showed me how to even sell a stock. We sold a portion to help pay for my college tuition. Over the years there were definitely times I wanted to sell for dumb reasons, like wanting to buy a new car, or start using it for options trading, or reinvest in some other fad. But I held off. \n\nNow, I need the money for a down payment on a first home for my wife and I. This ticker has always been in my brokerage account alongside every other trade I've done. It was really hard selling it, but I know it's exactly why I've been holding it all these years. Now, it's giving me the opportunity to afford a home for my family, and I am unspeakably grateful. \n\nI'm fortunate enough that my grandparents are still around and I can tell them myself how much of a gift they gave me all those years ago. I kept a few shares for the sentimentality, maybe I'll pass them down someday too. \n\nNet profit of 11,093% (estimated from MSFT's average on my birth year, it's been so long that the brokerage doesn't have the cost basis anymore)",
