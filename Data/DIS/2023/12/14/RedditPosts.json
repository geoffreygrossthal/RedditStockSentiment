        "content": "Apple (AAPL) achieved a new record high yesterday, closing at $197.96, up 1.67% for the day. \r  \n\r  \nThe company consistently outperforms its peers and is one of only five US companies valued at over $1 trillion. Notably, on December 6, 2023, Apple surpassed a $3 trillion total market valuation. \r  \n\r  \nThroughout 2023, Apple increased its market cap by $1 trillion, reaching a total valuation of $4 trillion expected in 2024 if the pace continues. \r  \n\r  \nOther companies with over $1 trillion valuations include Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia. The gap between Apple and Microsoft is around $220 billion. \r  \n\r  \nWhile these figures are interesting to observe, they don't mean much unless you're a stockholder. Apple's market cap is likely to reach $4 trillion in 2024 if its pace doesn't slow down, and with Apple Vision Pro on the horizon, anything is possible\r  \n",
