        "content": "I read claims recently that there are \"psychological barriers\" below which Tesla could not fall. At one point, the \"barrier\" was claimed to be $1,000. Then $900. Most recently I saw claims it was $700.\n\nThere clearly are no barriers. Some folks try to make them sound more real by giving them names like \"support level\".\n\nI am really bullish about Tesla as a company, but really bearish about the price. If it hits $160, I will start buying, and then DCA from there down.",
