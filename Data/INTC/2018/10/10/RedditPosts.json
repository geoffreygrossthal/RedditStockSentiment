        "content": "I talked about the idea [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/9mvabs/z/e7htx2q), and it's a simple one, but potentially lucrative. All that needs to be done is identify public companies with major product lines enjoyed particularly by basic white girls and equal weight them. Intuitively it makes sense; these are customers with money and the ability to set cultural trends. Here is the American white girl index as I currently have it:\n\n* AAPL\n\n* DECK\n\n* DIS\n\n* EL\n\n* FB\n\n* LB\n\n* LULU\n\n* NKE\n\n* SBUX\n\n* UAA\n\n* ULTA\n\n* VFC\n\nIf we add foreign stocks, we can include these:\n\n* ADDYY\n\n* DEO\n\n* LRLCY\n\n* LVMUY\n\nI don't remember the rest of what we came up with, but regardless, backtest and behold. White girls crush the market.\n\nEDIT: I'm back in this thread, and I agree about several of the proposed additions, most notably TIF. A lot of you are asking why I left out SNAP, though. I simply forgot about it, but even if I didn't, it's been public for such a short time that it would screw up any decent backtest, and I would probably not include a company with no history of positive EPS anyways. That said, if any of you put some money into a scheme like this, feel free to add or subtract whatever you want. I am powerless to stop you.\n\nEDIT2: In accordance with community consensus, we can go ahead and add these:\n\n* ETSY\n\n* FIZZ\n\n* GOOS\n\n* NFLX\n\n* SNAP\n\n* TGT\n\n* TIF\n\nI personally would decline to add a couple of those due either to very recent IPOs or a lack of history of profitability, but they do fit the stereotypes.",
