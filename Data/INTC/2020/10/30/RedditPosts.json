With only [four days to go until Election Day](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/30/politics/what-matters-october-29/index.html), rising [Covid-19 infections](https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-10-30-20-intl/index.html) and uncertainty about further government stimulus to help the economy, there's plenty for investors to worry about.  \n>  \n>Stocks had their worst week since March, when the market tumbled under the first wave of coronavirus infections and lockdowns -- and one of their worst weeks of the year as a whole.All three major indexes also recorded the second straight month of losses.The Dow ([INDU](https://money.cnn.com/data/markets/dow/?source=story_quote_link)) fell 6.5% on the week while the S&P 500 ([SPX](https://money.cnn.com/data/markets/sandp/?source=story_quote_link)), the broadest measure of Wall Street, dropped 5.6%. Though we're not back in lockdown mode yet, some European [countries have tightened restrictions again](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/29/europe/europe-coronavirus-local-national-lockdown-intl/index.html) to combat a second wave.The Dow closed down 0.6%, or 158 points, on Friday. It was also its worst month of the year since March.The S&P ended the day 1.2% lower.But the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite ([COMP](https://money.cnn.com/data/markets/nasdaq/?source=story_quote_link)) fared the worst on Friday, as [tech stocks got clobbered](http://www.cnn.com/2020/10/30/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html). Shares of Twitter, for example, closed [down more than 20%](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/29/tech/twitter-earnings/index.html), following the company's earnings Thursday. Apple ([AAPL](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AAPL&source=story_quote_link)) and Amazon ([AMZN](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AMZN&source=story_quote_link)) [shares also tumbled](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/29/tech/apple-fourth-quarter-earnings/index.html) after their[ earnings reports](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/29/business/amazon-earnings/index.html).The Nasdaq finished down 2.5% on Friday, for a drop of 5.5% on the week.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/30/investing/dow-stock-market-today/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2020/10/30/investing/dow-stock-market-today/index.html)",
