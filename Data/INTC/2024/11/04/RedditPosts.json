        "content": "\nNvidia stock was rising early Monday, pushing its market capitalization past Apple's to make the chip maker the world's largest company.\n\nNvidia shares were up 1.4% at $137.35 in early trading. The stock rose 2% on Friday.\n\nThat gave Nvidia a market cap of $3.365 trillion, just ahead of Apple's $3.338 trillion, according to Dow Jones Market Data.\n\nContinued high spending from big technology companies on artificial-intelligence infrastructure, including the company's Blackwell processors, look to be a more fundamental driver for Nvidia stock.\n\n\"We have further raised our big tech capex forecasts following the quarterly results last week. We now expect their combined spending to grow 50% this year to $222 billion, and another 20% to $267 billion in 2025,\" wrote Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a research note.\n\nIntel shares were down 2.9% in morning trading. Among other chip makers, Advanced Micro Devices was off 0.6% and Broadcom rose 1.7%.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",
