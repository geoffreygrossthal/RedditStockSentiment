        "content": "Intels Q3 earnings are due on 30/10. Estimated EPS is -0.02, so expectations are low. With the release of xeon 6, in Q2 I think server could be decent.\nXeon 6 gets obliterated by AMD Turin, but the later was released in October, so it'll impact Q4 sales.\n\nArrow Lake does not perform too well, as was expected. So I don't think intel managed to turn around yet. But expectations are low. Also, [rumors about takeovers](https://youtu.be/PKUXU1gewco?si=wdeSAt3qJxWeoZlZ) could boost the stock in the coming week.\n\nSo, I'm bullish, but Intel being Intel, I'm not going to yolo this one.",
