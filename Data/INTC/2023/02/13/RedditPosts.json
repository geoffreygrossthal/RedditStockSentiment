So, if they do reach that point and meet those eligibility requirements, they certainly will be eligible for funding,\" Stuart Anderson, head of Iowa's transportation development division, told Reuters.\n\nTesla has already had a boost from the Biden administration's EV push in February, when the DOT tweaked its $7,500 tax credit consumer incentive plan to include more eligible models by expanding the definition of an SUV. That increased the potential demand for some of Tesla's models.Â \n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk met with two White House officials last month to discuss ramping up EV production and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which includes the legislation on charging equipment.\n\nMusk has spoken in the past about opening up the Supercharger network, but hasn't moved publicly to let others in. Tesla is dominant in chargers in the US, and it has a huge private network of more than 40,000 EV chargers globally.",
