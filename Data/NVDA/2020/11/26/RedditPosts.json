        "content": "https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-market-capitalization-warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-2020-11?amp\n\nBuffett's company earned $255 billion in revenue and booked $73 billion in investment gains last year, fueling $81 billion in net income. Moreover, it held $137 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of March — enough to buy Tesla in its entirety at the time, as its market value had tumbled below $100 billion during the coronavirus crash.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla had about 48,000 full-time workers last year, less than an eighth of Berkshire's workforce. It also generated about $25 billion in sales — a tenth of Berkshire's revenue — and posted a $900 million net loss. Musk's company also had only $6.6 billion in net assets last year, less than 1/60th of Berkshire's $425 billion.\n\nupdate: tesla market cap 544 B vs brk-b 547 B now.\n\nThanks for the awards.",
