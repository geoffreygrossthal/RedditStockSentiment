I'm not a political person, just trading off an idea!\n\nSo here's what I did:  \n  \nBought $15,000 on 3:1 Kamala bets to win $30,000 to hedge my $50,000 in TSLA weekly calls. If she had won, I'd lose $10K-15K Max. If Trump won, this happens... Rolled my weekly calls to 29 Nov/ 20 Dec and held till today. Closed 95%.",

The assumptions required are Free Cash Flow growth for 2024-2032, discount rate which takes into account time value of money and risk, perpetual growth which means FCF growth after 2032 and lastly I get the intrinsic value. I'll show my table with it's assumptions so you can tell me whether they should realistic or I should adjust some variable to be more realistic. I understand that these assumptions are optimistic but I am also optimistic about the companies so the numbers make sense to me. Discount rate is always 7.75% and Perpetual 3% so I'll just show my assumptions on FCF Growth for 2024-2032 and Intrinsic Value/DCF Price and the current price.

        "content": "Ladies and Gentlemen, let me explain to you why IONQ, though up 84%YTD, is about to start an explosive bull run.\n\n**What is IonQ?** Backed by Industry Veterans from companies such as NVIDIA, Amazon, Dell, Microsoft: IonQ is a quantum computing hardware and software company, developing a general-purpose trapped ion quantum computer and software to generate, optimize, and execute quantum circuits.  Quantum computers will not take over traditional computers, but rather will exist alongside them.  For certain computational tasks, you currently need 2,500,000,000 GPUs worth of energy to solve what ONE Quantum Computer will be able to do near-term, an unbelievable saving in energy.  Explaining Quantum Computing as a whole would take several paragraphs, I encourage you to watch this beginner video if interested: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3U1NDUiwSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3U1NDUiwSA) \n\nQuantum computers have just recently become more powerful than the worlds largest supercomputers for certain problems.\n\n**Energy** \\- With the rise in AI energy usage, we’re expected to double our energy consumption demands over the next few years.  Everyone seems to think building up a ton of nuclear reactors and power plants will be the solution to this new energy issue, but the CEO of IonQ disagrees.  He believes Quantum Computing can help AI drastically reduce its energy necessity. \n\n**AQ64, The Catalysts of all Catalysts** \\- A task ran with AQ64 will use 18 Kilowatts of power, comparatively to **multiple billions** of kilowatts for an equivalent task on a GPU.   IonQ says reaching AQ64 will be a “ChatGPT” moment for Quantum Computing, equating to the recent AI boom of just a few years ago.  AQ64 is expected to release towards the end of 2025, but they have consistently CRUSHED target dates, beating their 2022 target date in 2022 by 2 months, 2023 by 7 months, and 2024 by 12 months.  AQ64 is coming sooner than we think.\n\n**UAE x Quantum**: XPANSE QUANTUM is an exclusive forum taking place Nov 20-22 in Abu Dhabi, focusing on cultivating strategic relationships with 2,500 key global leaders in the UAE, and the GCC region.  Obviously they have a ton of money, and with the USA and China recently pouring billions into a new “Quantum Race”, it’s in their best interest to get involved.\n\n**Elise Stefanik, UN 2025 and the “year of quantum”** \\- Elise Stefanik was recently, as of 8 hours ago, appointed as UN Ambassador by Donald Trump.  Stefanik has close ties with IonQ [https://x.com/RepStefanik/status/1801346033902825524](https://x.com/RepStefanik/status/1801346033902825524) , and is a strong believer in the US beating China in the “Quantum Race”  Currently, the USA has only issued 1.2 Billion$ to be invested in Quantum over the next 5 years, while China has invested 15 Billion$.  So far, IonQ has received just 54.5M$ from the United States Air Force Research Lab… but that’s about to change…\n\nThe United Nations has proclaimed 2025 as the International “Year of Quantum Science and Technology”.  Elise Stefanik is the new UN Ambassador, wants to beat China in the “Quantum Race”, and the entire globe is about to accelerate Quantum development… Get it yet?\n\nThe last topic I will mention is Blockchain and Encryption being at threat due to Quantum Computing:  I don’t know enough of this, so I’ll quote one line and leave a link: “Quantum computers could potentially break current blockchain encryption, risking billions in cryptocurrency assets, according to a quantum policy expert.” [https://thequantuminsider.com/2024/09/08/blockchain-and-quantum-computing-are-on-a-collision-course-expert-warns/](https://thequantuminsider.com/2024/09/08/blockchain-and-quantum-computing-are-on-a-collision-course-expert-warns/)\n\n**Why not other quantum companies?** Compared to other companies Algorithmic Qubits (AQ), IonQ has achieved near to ideal fidelity, AKA, their methods actually work, whereas other companies fail.  On top of this, IONQ has recently begun a spree of not only partnering with, but also acquiring multiple companies in a strategic play to make themselves a defining leader in this emerging sector. \n\nFirst came the CPU, then the GPU, next up: the QPU.  So far Quantum Computing has found Value in potential Market Sizes of up to $220 Billion USD, expecting to be in the Trillions in a few years.  None of this is financial advice, and do your own research.\n\n**Positions:** 10,900 Shares, \\~25k$ in 4/17/25
