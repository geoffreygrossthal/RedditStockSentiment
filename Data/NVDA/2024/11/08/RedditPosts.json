You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.",

Automakers will have to respond and they aren’t going to use Tesla or Waymo since those are competitive threats. The only viable solution will be MBLY.\n\nMBLY already announced Volkswagen as their first main autonomous driving win. At their upcoming Dec 9th analyst day, we may get more announcements. A year from now, all of the big 10 automakers will have a plan for autonomous driving and most of them likely select MBLY.\n\nEach customer like Volkswagen is \\~$3b revenue a year (9m cars @ 25% attach rate @ $1500 ASP).

Instead, I had the audacity to do something unheard of in this sub: RisK MiTigAtiOn.\n\nBasically at the height of my profits I transferred most of my money out of my margin trading account and into another cash trading account (and into basic bitch ETFs). This saved my ass because I would definitely would have gone full regard and shorted TSLA with a position 3x larger than what I actually did = 3x larger loss.\n\nSo for you fellow degens who have mooned recently, congrats, fuck you, and consider implementing measures to curb your degeneracy. Lock your gains into ETFs, change your account from margin to cash, or transfer your assets to your wife or to her boyfriend since it’ll eventually go to him anyway.\n\nIn any case, see you at Wendy’s.

This materialized as DAL and UAL continued their rally, with DAL up another 30% to 60 since my previous DD, primarily driven by US election results and the Trump Trade.  \n\nWith the upcoming holiday season, tourism and air travel are at the top of mind – DAL and UAL are two domestic airlines best positioned on international, premium, and holiday travel. While UAL offers more INTL, DAL leads in premium and reliability, which are essential for vacation trips. \n\nTo get ahead of the holiday season, we aim to gain insight and forecast holiday travel demand and color on air travel going into 2025. With the recent election, recent MAR, ABNB, and EXPE earnings, and shifting macro trends, this post will focus more on forecasting and market dynamics rather than idiosyncrasies within the AI and DAL.

I chose to gain exposure through DAL; here is a quick overview of DAL Q3 performance:\n\n* DAL YTD profitability to represent 50% of the AI total \n* Double-digit ROIC twice industry average (UAL comparison unknown) \n* Strong premium, loyalty, and co-spend program revenue representing over 50% of total revenue \n* Projected 30% earnings growth in Q4 on growing demand trends \n* Transatlantic benefiting from US strength likely to continue, transatlantic and domestic strongest trends \n* Corporate sales up 7%, corroborating EXPE B2B numbers \n* AMEX remuneration up 6%, lowering inflation backdrop \n* CEO to give more color on tightening domestic capacity, moat, strategic plan on Investor Day 11/20 \n* Volume growth following 2019 baseline rather than 2023, late summer peak travel shifting later into the fall due to weather trends \n* Less enthusiastic about promotional and marketing compared to UAL – is this the right move competitively? \n* Main cabin underperformance main driver of capacity cuts, premium/main spread increasing but both categories to enjoy expanding margins \n* Innovative technological solutions to drive value, including drones (govt. approved) for maintenance inspections  \n\nThroughout the Q3 earnings call, management emphasized Investor Day 2024 to analysts – signaling it to be a significant catalyst. Historically, DAL Investor Day has been a strong catalyst, with DAL rallying 5% on Investor Day in 2023. With all the mention of Transatlantic and domestic strength, airlines are already ahead of the curve by betting on NA-EU travel this upcoming holiday season (https://www.wsj.com/business/airlines/airlines-bank-on-americans-steady-love-of-european-travel-f64b51b3). As a tangent: potential upcoming trade opportunity will be comparing actual TSA check-in data during the winter months and trade off the spread between current AI optimism on Q4 travel and modeling what the actual data represents. \n\nMy Positions: \n\n* 45 Jan25 $55 Calls \n* 100 Jan25 $60 Calls \n* 150 Jan 25 $70 Calls \n* Total position: 100k in Jan25 options \n\ntldr; who needs NVDA when you have the secret AI (airline industry) trade, already turned 4 bagger trading airlines but I plan on riding this plane to the moon right behind Elon",

        "content": "Looking back at the history of U.S. stocks, all the bull and bear markets after the Great Depression, it is worthwhile for us to go like a history textbook to learn a little.\nTo rise 20% as the standard, the past 50 years a total of seven bull market, with the A shares of the bear long bull short different, U.S. stock history is a bull long bear short history, the following we review one by one.\n\n\n1. 1970-1973:\nStarting from the famous “Nifty Fifty”, the “ Pretty 50 ‘, the popular investment theme at that time was what we later knew as the ’Pretty 50”, which included a series of high-profile companies such as McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Polaroid, etc. At that time, these stocks were characterized by high earnings growth and high PEs. These companies included McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Polaroid, and a series of other high-profile companies, and at that time, these stocks were characterized by high performance growth, and at the same time, the PE was also very high. From a paper found online that specializes in the study of that time, we see that in 1972 Polaroid PE was 91 times, McDonald's was 86 times, and Coca-Cola was 48 times. Eventually, the bubble burst in 1973, when the PE of the S&P 500 was 18x\n\n2. 1974-1980:\nDuring that period in the 70's and 80's, inflation was stronger and interest rate levels went all the way up. in 1980, inflation was as high as 13.5% and interest rates were raised to 20%, a figure that might be unimaginable today. In the midst of all this raising of interest rates along the way, this last leg of the bull market came to an end when the PE of the S&P 500 was only 7.5\n\n3. 1982-1987:\nAnother new cycle began, inflation was curbed, interest rates began a long downward spiral that continues to this day, and with various tax cuts, a new bull market was up. The five-year bull market lasted until Black Monday in 1987, when the broad market fell 22% in one day. In fact, the PE of the broad market at that time was not too high, 15 times PE. This crash was rather sudden, and there are also claims that the computerized trading model introduced at that time led to this rapid plunge. However, since then, the meltdown mechanism has been invented\n\n4. 1987-1990:\nThe selloff brought on by Black Monday was quickly followed by a rally, a rallying bull of sorts as the broader market accumulated a 65% gain by 1990. By 1990, interest rates once again stayed high because of the rising oil prices at the time, and the 10% interest rate level was never seen again for 30 years after that. At that time, the broad market PE was 15 times, which was not too high, and the index decline lasted only three months before it was over\n\n5. 1990-2000：\nThe 90's were good and beautiful, and the 10-year-long bull market was about to kick off. This decade the U.S. economy is good, Windows95, Windows98, Yahoo, the Internet has brought unlimited imagination, the feeling is not immediately into the new century, but into the new world. Ten years, the general market rose more than 4 times, are epic. Eventually the internet bubble bubbled, Amazon went from a high of 100 bucks, down to a few bucks, while the S&P 500 lost 50% of its value\n\n6. 2002-2007:\nThe low interest rate level and zero down payment to buy a house, if you are interested, you can go and watch the movie “The Big Short” again, which describes it in a very easy-to-understand way. You can buy a house with no money, and when you do, home prices go up, and you feel happier to spend money when you have money, and the guys get high. Wall Street has repackaged these subprime zero-down mortgages into a product that is complicated for everyone to understand, but looks like an oxymoron, so how can you not make money? The farce had to end, and it did, with the 2008 subprime crisis, which left 8 million people unemployed, 6 million homeless, and the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression in the U.S. Between 2007 and 2009, the S&P 500 lost nearly 60% of its value, Citibank lost 97% of its market capitalization, and Lehman Brothers went bankrupt.\n\n7. 2009-Present:\nAfter the subprime mortgage crisis cleared up, U.S. stocks had one of the longest bull markets in history. It was also an era when large U.S. technology companies became stock market leaders. more than a decade after the release of the iPhone in 2007, Apple became the world's largest company by market capitalization. Microsoft, which had almost been forgotten, returned to the top of its market capitalization after transforming itself into cloud computing. And then there's Amazon, left over from the last Internet bubble, and Google, the Google created during the last Internet bubble, have grown to become giants with market capitalizations of over $2 trillion dollars\n\n The next time?",

So, first question, did I not search properly? What do you use?\n\nTherefore, I started developing mine :)  \nBut I am having problems with the Hurst exponent/scalability (it is utilized to evaluate the extent of long-term reliance in market predictability), I don't understand how to interpret the results or there is a bug in the code (less likely, or in the data).\n\n[https://github.com/packmad/Riskstats](https://github.com/packmad/Riskstats)\n\nI am posting here the results of some well known assets, ordered by the exponent:\n\n|ticker|name|hurst\\_scale\\_factor|hurst\\_exponent|\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\n|NVDA|NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)|0.0583817|1.37871|\n|BTC-USD|Bitcoin USD (BTC-USD)|0.0881427|1.30595|\n|TSLA|Tesla, Inc.

Shouldn't they be extremely high? \n\nCheers!",
