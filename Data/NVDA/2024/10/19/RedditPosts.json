        "content": "So i decided to do some data analysis with ChatGPT on the NVDA stock prices and came across some interesting data. Yesterday's bar for NVDA was an inside bar. For those that are not familiar, an inside bar is when its high is lower than the previous days high and low is higher than the previous days low.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/7hp29qxcgqvd1.png?width=121&format=png&auto=webp&s=164371a63e2b6f36d5e08740d8efc8cf0952ba00\n\nSo I decided to find out what happened the last many times this has happened. There have been 12 instances of this since July 2024 and guess what, 6 of them have formed on a Friday. Here is the list of all fridays when this happened -\n\n|| || |9/13/2024| |8/30/2024| |8/23/2024| |7/26/2024| |7/19/2024| |7/12/2024 |\n\n5 of these 6 times the stock tanked the next monday and tuesday. the only time it went higher on monday was on 19th July, but it was down by wednesday and deep in red by Friday.\n\nTLDR: Inside bar analysis from past 3 months shows that NVDA stock price will fall on Monday or by end of next week.\n\nEdit1: Since someone pointed out that NVDA was in a bear trend since july and this was bound to happen. Here is list of all dates on Friday within the last year when we had an inside bar formed:\n\n|| || |9/13/2024| |8/30/2024| |8/23/2024| |7/26/2024| |7/19/2024| |7/12/2024| |4/12/2024| |4/5/2024| |1/12/2024| |11/24/2023| |10/27/2023|\n\nOut of the 12 dates, on 10 occasions the price fell the next monday and tuesday.\n\n  \nEdit 2: Got burned yesterday!! But I still believe by end of week prices around 130-135. ",
