        "content": "For me it’s Tesla. They were a disruptor in the automotive industry but their QC is getting quite poor and dare I say it, other brands are starting to make superior products. I definitely don’t see their reign lasting forever.\n\n\nEdit: This has been super interesting now that it’s gained a lot of traction so I wanted to clarify a few things about my stance on Tesla.\n\nYes I know Tesla leads the market in self driving, but they may not forever. No single tech company dominates the market for forever, so who knows how long their run might last, could easily go on another decade or two but I sure wont bet on it. I do think they have two huge strengths, however. 1) The ability to keep up with demand better than almost any other automaker and mass produce electric vehicles 2) Brand loyalty, almost like Apple in a sense. With all that being said, their P/E is absurd and I feel like one day the stock may be exposed for what it is. Does that mean I’m willing to short it? Not at all, I’ll just never directly buy any. \n\nSome of these answers have been amazing, and made me realize I’d buy Tesla way before a few other companies. Not sure why it came to mind before HOOD, TWTR, WISH but I wouldn’t touch any of those with a ten foot pole.",
