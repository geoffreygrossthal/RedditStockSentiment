The celebrity executive disposed of 19.5 million shares Tuesday, which is worth about $3.95 billion, according to three filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nMusk did not take to Twitter to explain why he sold shares, but itâ€™s possible the money will go towards his $44 billion deal to buy the social media platform, which went through last month.\n\nIn April, Musk also sold around 9.6 million shares of Tesla stock, which at the time was worth $8.5 billion. Those shares were sold at around $885.42. Since then, Tesla has issued a three-for-one stock split, bringing the cost of each share down.\n\nMusk sold shares Tuesday at an average price of $202.56 each.\n\nTesla is currently trading at $191.30 after hours.\n\n-----------\n\n$TSLA TESLA UPDATED INSIDER BUYING / SELLING OVER THE LAST YEAR  \n  \nBuy Transactions: 0  \nBuy amount: 0  \nSell Transactions: 1455  \nSell amount: $35,974,783,779\n  \nSource: https://twitter.com/gurgavin/status/1590159021499379712",
