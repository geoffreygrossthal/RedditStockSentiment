As of last Saturday, disconnects were running at nearly 8x the daily levels observed in August — a multi-year high, YipitData added.\n\nStill, despite the downbeat data, the cancellations should not have much of a lasting impact on Netflix’s overall subscriber base. The platform has well over 182 million users worldwide and is the clear leader in the competitive streaming space — regardless of its recent controversies.\n\nThanks for the awards.",
