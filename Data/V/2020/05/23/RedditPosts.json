        "content": "Back in 1996-ish, I was a senior in college taking a marketing class. Discovered the internet. Asked my teacher “who owns the internet?” He said “no one, but AOL and Microsoft seem to be the most involved. My parents had put away some bonds for me, so I used that money to buy 100 shares of both companies (I believe they were $10 or under). \n\nMade about $60,000. Sold stock and bought a house a block from the beach in Southern California for $500,000 in 2000. Sold that two years later for $600,000. Everyone celebrate.\n\nGot married, continued to buy houses and make money. Got divorced in 2006, lost about 50% of equity in the crash. \n\nThat first beach house is now worth $2+ million. And I don’t even want to do the math on profit if I had kept the stocks. \n\nMoral: keep stocks and real estate for 25 years and spend all extra money on marriage therapy!\n\n*Edit: for all of you blaming “the wife” for the loss, you should know I was the wife. Surprise, it’s a girl.",
