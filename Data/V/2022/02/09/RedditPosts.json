The two big areas of growth people seem to have for Nvidia is the self driving space and the metaverse. Self driving is years away from being viable and there are many players. Isn't metaverse the exact thing that has demolished $FB's market cap? How can you be bullish on one and bearish on the other for the exact same thing?\n\nEarnings are next week and everything seems to scream this is going under. At the same time I am remembering that markets can remain irrational for longer than I can remain solvent.\n\nI'm interested in hearing why this stock demands such a premium.",
