        "content": "https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/05/target-offers-employees-extra-2-an-hour-for-peak-days-of-holiday-season.html\n\nTarget said it will pay an extra $2 an hour to store and service center employees who work peak days during the holiday season, such as on Saturdays and Sundays in the final weeks before Christmas.\n\nThe big-box retailer previously said it would scale back holiday hiring and give more hours to its staff.\n\nThe retailer is offering higher pay as many retailers struggle to fill jobs and focus on retaining employees ahead of the peak shopping season.\n\nTarget is a good non tech stock to buy during the recent selloff. The company is still heavily invested to the e-commerce and curbside pickup operations. It will be one of the beneficiary of the upcoming holiday season. Target will be able to compete with Amazon and Walmart.\n\nThanks for the awards.",
