        "content": "NVIDIA (NVDA) said Friday its board has approved a four-for-one split of its common stock in the form of a stock dividend.\n\nThe computer systems design services company said the move would make stock ownership more accessible to investors and employees. The dividend is conditioned on shareholder approval at the company's annual meeting in June to increase the number of authorized shares to 4 billion, the company said.\n\nIf approved, each NVIDIA (NVDA) shareholder of record at the close of business on June 21 will receive a dividend of three additional shares for every share held, which will be distributed after the close of trading on July 19.",
