Looks like it is (maybe was) a good runner, with apple using it for their satellite cell service, and non-emergency use/satellite text coming in 2025.\n\nProblem: SpaceX/Starlink and GSAT are in a battle over satellite radio bands. FCC dismissed SpaceX's request to basically take over GSAT's dedicated section of bandwidth.\n\nBut Musk is now firmly latched onto future POTUS, in what is certain to become a grifty political-economic symbiosis.\n\nWhat's the liklihood Musk tries to court government favors from the white house/FCC to give SpaceX a (probably illegal, but laws don't matter anymore) leg up?",

These two companies have been orphaned ever since their conservatorship 15+ years ago. During Trump's first presidency he implemented steps to re-privatize the entities and with him back in office the market reacted accordingly. I started building my position in the junior preferreds a little over a year ago.\n\nShould mention that there is still room to run. Most of the junior preferred issues are trading at around 30% of their face value. I only hold the junior preferred shares as the common will most likely get wiped in any recap and release scenario. \n\nIt will be interesting to see who Trump picks as his treasury secretary in the coming weeks. John Paulson is one of the names being floated around - he famously bet against subprime mortgages during the GFC and holds a large amount of Fannie and Freddie junior preferreds. \n\n[Ignore other financial company holdings - virtually all gains coming from Fannie and Freddie JPS](https://preview.redd.it/q6o6mipgprzd1.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=880dad11ef1c86ff4ed5d4820b8d206e1d20ab87)\n\n  \n",

        "content": "You have seen in recent news that lots of data centers and AI fueled companies are looking for sustainable carbon free energy. That still isn't enough for the likes of amzn, and msft. They need sustainable STABLE energy. Nuclear is the only real option to hit this. Wind and solar energy are not feasible and if we are honest to ourselves, they simply aren't efficient enough. This is why nuclear is needed. \n\nMany disasters have occured: chernobyl, three mile island, and fukushima to name a few. This has caused the public to have a negative outlook on the technology. Many people believe wrongly that these reactors will destroy the world, when in fact post construction they are some of the safest forms of energy production.\n\nThe issue in the past with traditional reactors are that these projects are super fund sites. BILLIONS of dollars, government regulations bloat the cost and balloon the build time. In order to get a new design, the government is the only source. A lengthy billion+ dollar gamble so most build off the last approved design making small improvements. \n\nEnter SMR's , small modular nuclear reactors. They are extremely small sites in comparison to traditional monstrosities. The safety zone surrounding a SMR set up is limited to the bounds of the actual generator site. This is a big deal because with traditional reactors you have to build out a secured zone 10+ miles around the actual sites perimeter. The costs continuously add up for traditional economies. \n\nWho is designing SMRS? Tons of people are attempting but it no longer matters. As of 2020, the company NuScale is the only company in the united states with an approved reactor design. Other companies attempting to design and theorize have already gained support from the private industry in most recent history Amazon did so. They are giving money to start ups who are 10+ YEARS behind NuScale in hopes of getting in early.\n\n  \nNuScale has lost money year over year but have done amazing at cutting down on costs and bloat reducing their year over year expenses drastically. They have received government assistance already in 2014 (https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/doe-approves-award-carbon-free-power-project), to the tune of 1.4b USD from the DOE which means government relations have already been built. \n\nThey went to deploy and test the reactors by building a 12 module reactor but fear of extra costs and hitting deadlines drove off private investors causing a halt on the project. AND YET NuScale performed relatively well in sustaining its value for a startup that's never made money. They continue to strive for a mid 2025 start to selling and commercializing their product to prove to the world it is safe and possible. I don't really think I need to explain in depth how AI data super centers, mass surveillance, quantum computing, and the general virtualization of everything will continue to drive the demand for stable sustainable energy and how that relates to NuScale.\n\n  \nYou may ask the following: \"How is this a small risk investment if you're claiming such higher performance?\", \"How are you sure we are going to go nuclear? The coming administration in the US wont be favorable to renewables!\", \"How do you think even if we are it will happen on a short time span?\"\n\n  \nI have answers. \n\n  \nEven if NuScale goes tits up in debt, has no way of securing contracts, gets beat out my competitors (impossible lol), IT STILL HAS ITS APPROVED DESIGN. That is their (for lack of a better term) trump card. It is worth the 24$ alone depending on who scoops them up to finish the mission. This leads me into the second nuclear stock. To supply this industry uranium will be needed. The government has been looking for a domestic supplier of fuel grade uranium that is ready for enrichment. Sadly, the enrichment game is mostly private holdings can't get in on that public goodness. But Uranium Energy Corp. has been making money moves, aquiring LIQUIDATABLE uranium and hodling it as hard as they can. Increasing mining, storage, and infrastructure capacities. They are ready for the next move. The united states is already trying to bid on BOTH A GenIII+ nuclear reactor(https://www.energy.gov/oced/generation-iii-small-modular-reactor-program), as well as a domestic supplier and enricher of fuel grade uranium(https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-four-contracts-boost-domestic-haleu-supply-and) <-- they have one for Low enriched as well.\n\nThe government is cheap and wants to save money. They have made a report investigating the savings made per killowat compared to the incentives given. They found they gave out 50+ billions and made jack shit return. They equated to do the same garbage return rate they'd only have to use 10 billion for the SMR tech coming out if they support the role out. \n\nEven with trump in office these stocks make sense to invest in for both hodling potential and short term options gamba. The government is already in favor of this, they will do whatever they need to change the public perception Hell, they don't even care., They will executive order whatever they need.  The following are reasons a trump office will help nuclear.\n\nHe has already stated that he will slash 4 or however many regulations per passed regulation. This will benefit all industries regardless of how you feel about it on an emotional level. Furthermore he wants a stronger American offense and defense. Putting SMRs into most states after commercial shows its viability will make for an invasion insurance, solar flare insurance, EMP insurance, supernova insurance, etc. SMRs are off grid capable. They can provide direct power hence the stability for data centers. If the grid goes down SMR's keep pumping. The steam they produce in the next generation will be more efficiently harvested for chemical manufacturing of ammonia and other reagents.\n\nEven with a strong want to continue using fossil fuels for trump, all the fossil fuel industries benefit. With the minimal space requirements needed essentially anywhere near any industry center a nuclear reactor could be built. And on the same page, lets talk about the building of this reactor(s) and its module(s).\n\n  \nIt is a modular system and NuScale has already put thought and money into fabrication plants to create the modular components, as well as invested in what they call E2 centers across the globe to train professionals to work at NuScale reactor sites. They aren't a tech bullshit startup with false promises they are actively confident and preparing for a 3 year explosion into the industry. They have made talks and contracts and centers in eastern europe namely romania, they have done the same in the middle east, they have done the same in africa specifically full blown university support from Ghana(https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ghana-signs-agreement-build-small-nuscale-nuclear-reactor-2024-08-29/). This shit is happening but retail regards still have their head in the sand. I think the big boys are waiting to blow this shit up over night in the coming few years.\n\n  \nI bought in at 22 something and it hit almost 26 the other day. UEC is a bit more volatile but in the exact same boat. This isnt a source of uncorrelated returns, these markets are both going online. And if tariffs happen, these people are MOONING. The signs are right in our faces.\n\nFINAL KEY POINTS AND WRAP UP FOR THE TLDREGARDS:\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Nuclear energy is happening short term and already has DOE support.\n\n\\*\\*\\*ONLY ENTITY THAT HAS AN APPROVED SMR DESIGN BY THE NUKE COMITEE IN THE US\\*\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*TRUMP SLASHING REGS ++ TARIFFS??\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*UEC MEETS DOE FUTURE GOALS AS DOMESTIC URANIUM SUPPLY\\*\n\n\\*US ALLIES URANIUM SUPPLIES FACE UNCERTAINTIES WHICH MEANS $$$$ FOR US SALES\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*MINIMAL RISK LONG TERM AS THEY BOTH HAVE AN EXTREMELY VALUABLE INTRINSIC ASSET REPSECITVELY\\*\\*\n\n\\*\\*EVERYTHING IS ON SCHEDULE ACCORDING TO NUSCALE SMR Q3 REPORT\\*\\*\\*\n\n  \nSOURCES::\n\n  \n[https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/doe-approves-award-carbon-free-power-project](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/doe-approves-award-carbon-free-power-project)\n\nhttps://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2018/11/f57/Examination%20of%20Federal%20Financial%20Assistance%20in%20the%20Renewable%20Energy%20Mark...\\_1.pdf\n\n[https://www.energy.gov/oced/generation-iii-small-modular-reactor-program](https://www.energy.gov/oced/generation-iii-small-modular-reactor-program)\n\n[https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-four-contracts-boost-domestic-haleu-supply-and](https://www.energy.gov/articles/biden-harris-administration-announces-four-contracts-boost-domestic-haleu-supply-and)\n\n[https://www.nuscalepower.com/en/news/press-releases/2024/nuscale-power-reports-third-quarter-2024-results](https://www.nuscalepower.com/en/news/press-releases/2024/nuscale-power-reports-third-quarter-2024-results)\n\n[https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ghana-signs-agreement-build-small-nuscale-nuclear-reactor-2024-08-29/](https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/ghana-signs-agreement-build-small-nuscale-nuclear-reactor-2024-08-29/)\n\n",
