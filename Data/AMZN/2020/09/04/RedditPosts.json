Making room for them are three names heading down to the MidCap 400: H&R Block (NYSE:HRB), Coty (NYSE:COTY) and Kohl's (NYSE:KSS). ETSY is +5.4% postmarket; TER +3.1%; COTY +0.8%; KSS +0.5%.\n\n>Making a market-cap move up to the MidCap 400 are SmallCap 600 constituents Wingstop (NASDAQ:WING), Medpace Holdings (NASDAQ:MEDP) and Fox Factory Holding (NASDAQ:FOXF). They're replacing PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF), Allegheny Technologies (NYSE:ATI) and Mack-Cali Realty (NYSE:CLI), all of which head down to the SmallCap 600. After hours: WING -0.9%; PBF +0.8%; ATI +3.5%.\n\n>Jazz Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:JAZZ) is also joining the MidCap 400, replacing Transocean (NYSE:RIG), which is no longer representative of the space. After hours: JAZZ +4.8%; RIG -0.8%.\n\n>And Mr. Cooper Group (NASDAQ:COOP) and R1 RCM (NASDAQ:RCM) are joining the SmallCap 600, replacing Express (NYSE:EXPR) and Pennsylvania Real Estate (NYSE:PEI).
