I excluded GME, NOK, AMC because I'm sure everyone is experiencing fatigue at the moment on why ThE SquEeZe iS nOt SqUoZe. You might think this is very subjective to what I think is \"popular\" or a quality post, so here were my requirements to be included.\n\n1. The post must have reached the hot section at any point during the week.\n2. Post types that WERE included: news, discussion, due diligence\n3. Post types that were NOT included: memes, YOLOs, shitposts, gains, losses, etc\n4. The post was included if it met a certain amount of engagement (upvotes, comments).\n\nThese are listed in no particular order. If this is something you guys like I will continue posting this, maybe weekly or bi-weekly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n|Post Title|Tickers|\n|:-|:-|\n|[AMZN Amazing interview of Jeff Bezos before becoming famous](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/lba6t3/amzn_amazing_interview_of_jeff_bezos_before/)|AMZN|\n|[ZACKS upgrades $BB (BlackBerry Limited) price target from 14$ to 29$](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ldwfm2/zacks_upgrades_bb_blackberry_limited_price_target/)|BB|\n|[BB is probably not the next GME, it's probably the next TSLA](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l8wdmf/bb_is_probably_not_the_next_gme_its_probably_the/)|BB|\n|[What I got out of Palantir Demo Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l61uln/what_i_got_out_of_palantir_demo_day/)|PLTR|\n|[Palantir rises from 52nd to 34th holding in ARKW](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/l6m2t9/palantir_rises_from_52nd_to_34th_holding_in_arkw/)|PLTR|\n|[I draw with crayons so you don't have to.
