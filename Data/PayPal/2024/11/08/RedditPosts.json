        "content": "This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme.\n\nSome helpful day to day links, including news:\n\n* [Finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=spy) for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks\n* [Bloomberg market news](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets)\n* StreetInsider news:\n  * [Market Check](https://www.streetinsider.com/Market+Check) - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips\n  * [Reuters aggregated](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters) - Global news\n\n-----\n\nMost fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.\n\nExpect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.\n\nBut growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count:  Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future.\n\nValue stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.  You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.\n\n\nSee the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:\n\n[Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/fundamentals-themed-post)\n\nIf you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.\n\nUseful links:\n\n* [Investopedia page](https://www.investopedia.com/fundamental-analysis-4689757/) on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow](https://www.investopedia.com/university/dcf/) analysis; see [definition here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) and read [their PDF on the topic.](http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/fundamentalanalysis_intro.pdf)\n* [FINVIZ](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=aapl) for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news\n* [Earnings Whisper](https://www.earningswhispers.com/stocks/aapl) for earnings details\n\nSee our past [daily discussions here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+%22r%2Fstocks+daily+discussion%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)  Also links for:  [Technicals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Atechnicals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Tuesday, [Options Trading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Aoptions&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Thursday, and [Fundamentals](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/search?q=author%3Aautomoderator+title%3Afundamentals&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=new&t=all) Friday.",

        "content": "MBLY (Mobileye) is the leader in autonomous driving technology supplying automakers. Elon will push Trump to encourage the expansion of autonomous driving for his Tesla Full Self Driving and robotaxis. Only three companies can do full autonomous driving: Tesla, Google’s Waymo, and Mobileye. Automakers will have to respond and they aren’t going to use Tesla or Waymo since those are competitive threats. The only viable solution will be MBLY.\n\nMBLY already announced Volkswagen as their first main autonomous driving win. At their upcoming Dec 9th analyst day, we may get more announcements. A year from now, all of the big 10 automakers will have a plan for autonomous driving and most of them likely select MBLY.\n\nEach customer like Volkswagen is \\~$3b revenue a year (9m cars @ 25% attach rate @ $1500 ASP). MBLY’s current revenue is $2b. So by 2028, MBLY’s revenue could be $15b vs $2b today. Meanwhile the stock is on lows due to near-term noise around weak total auto units industry wide, etc, creating a great entry point.\n\n$MBLY is my next 10 bagger. In 2027, the stock will be $170.",

        "content": "Hello fellow degens, some of you may remember my earlier post about making $70k shorting TSLA this year (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1g9hus6/70k_profit_from_shorting_tsla/). \n\nAs you can guess this strategy has not worked well this month and my YTD profit from my favorite EV company is now down to $40k (see second pic)\n\nBut please indulge my big brain boast about not completely fucking it up because in an alternate universe, I would have completely wiped my portfolio. Instead, I had the audacity to do something unheard of in this sub: RisK MiTigAtiOn.\n\nBasically at the height of my profits I transferred most of my money out of my margin trading account and into another cash trading account (and into basic bitch ETFs). This saved my ass because I would definitely would have gone full regard and shorted TSLA with a position 3x larger than what I actually did = 3x larger loss.\n\nSo for you fellow degens who have mooned recently, congrats, fuck you, and consider implementing measures to curb your degeneracy. Lock your gains into ETFs, change your account from margin to cash, or transfer your assets to your wife or to her boyfriend since it’ll eventually go to him anyway.\n\nIn any case, see you at Wendy’s.
