        "content": "Pinterest shares plunged 15% Thursday after the social media company provided soft guidance for its fourth-quarter revenue despite it beating the top and bottom lines with its third-quarter earnings.\n\nHere’s how the company performed, according to LSEG:\n\n* **Revenue**: $898 million vs. $896 million expected\n* **Earnings per share:** 40 cents adjusted vs. 34 cents expected\n\nThe company said that fourth-quarter revenue will be between the range of $1.125 million to $1.145 million. The midpoint of the fourth-quarter guidance, $1.135 million, trailed analyst estimates of $1.143 million.\n\nSales in Pinterest’s third-quarter rose 18% from $763.2 million a year ago.\n\nPinterest said it had 537 million global monthly active users in the third quarter, topping analyst estimates of 532.6 million.  \n\nThe company’s net income grew a whopping 354% year over year to $30.56 million. Its total cost and expenses for the quarter were $904 million, up 17% compared with $768 million the previous year.\n\nPinterest’s latest quarterly earnings follows the recent U.S. presidential election earlier in the week in addition to multiple earnings reports from other tech companies with online advertising businesses.\n\nLast week, Amazon said its ads business grew 19% year over year to $14.3 billion in the third quarter, and Meta said its third-quarter sales rose 19% year over year to $40.59 billion. However, Meta shares dropped slightly on weaker-than-expected user numbers and warned of a significant acceleration in its infrastructure expenses in 2025.\n\nAlphabet said during its third-quarter earnings last week that advertising sales in the period grew 10% year over year to $65.85 billion while its YouTube video unit reported ad revenue of $8.92 billion, up 12% from the previous year.\n\nMicrosoft said last week that its search and news advertising revenue jumped 18% year over year as part of its latest earnings report, but the company does not reveal that unit’s specific quarterly sales numbers.\n\nReddit and Snap also reported their most recent quarterly earnings last week. Reddit said that sales in its third quarter soared 68% to $348.4 million from the prior year while Snap’s third-quarter revenue grew 15% year over year to $1.37 billion.\n\nSource: [https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/pinterest-pins-q3-earnings-report-2024.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/pinterest-pins-q3-earnings-report-2024.html)",

Mom never worked and my dad’s income has never been much (minister at small church). Unsurprisingly, mom and dad want to cash in on that sweet sweet inheritance $$$ by selling the farm and upgrading their lifestyle with the proceeds.\n\nI would give my right kidney to keep that farm if I knew how to sell it. It’s where I grew up, convinced my girlfriend (now wife) to marry me, and want our two small children to make their own memories there. \n\nI’ve traded positions in $NVDA, $ASTS, $RKLB and $RDDT (thanks to this community) hoping to somehow make enough to buy the farm but have only managed roughly to double my money ($15K to $32K). I completely realize it’s an idiot move but it’s the only chance I have at this point and I’m 100% willing to go to $0 if there is a chance I can make it to $1.1MM. \n\nThe farm is going to be listed next week and I want to go full regard with my portfolio to buy it. If I sell my house I still need $1.1MM to make up the difference and I’m willing to bet everything I have in the market for the chance to make it happen. \n\nWould happily go all-in on anything that might print before February since the farm will probably be sold around that time. \n\nBefore anyone asks, there is no other way. My folks want the $$$ now and won’t sell the farm for any less than market value to me or anyone else. Renting the tillable acres to a local farmer would only cover 1.5 months of the mortgage payment. Maybe the best offer is $800K, maybe the real estate market crashes tomorrow, but bottom line is I have to close the gap between $35K and $1.1MM to have any shot at keeping it. \n\nTLDR: regard wants to yolo his 100% gains on a moonshot to save his sentimentality important childhood home knowing full well he should blow it on strippers stead because it would be more fun. \n\nThanks in advance!

        "content": "Regards,\n\nListen up - here’s the deal on QXO. I’m not here to give you some penny stock pitch that’s gonna end with you crying to your bank. I’m talking Brad Jacobs—a name that actually commands respect in business. He took XPO from being small fry to a $15 billion freight monster, and now he’s back for another round. But let’s be real, if you’re looking for some pump-and-dump garbage, this ain’t for you.\n\nThe Big Picture: Owning a $1 Trillion Industry\nJacobs doesn’t mess around. He’s here to take over the building products distribution market, which is a trillion-dollar industry begging for a savior to come in and shake it up. When he took on XPO, the logistics industry was a hot mess of inefficiency and disarray. Fast-forward a decade, and XPO is a name every freight guy knows. Now he’s got his sights set on QXO, and this isn’t for some pocket change. This is a takeover.\n\n$5 Billion Cash Stash and No Debt—No Chains Holding QXO Back\nUnlike all those broke startups praying for investor mercy, QXO has $5 billion in cold, hard cash with zero debt. That’s right—no loans, no strings, no BS holding them back. They’re not out here begging for quarters; they’re ready to buy, expand, and roll out a carpet of domination.\n\nWhy does that matter? Because QXO doesn’t need to play games. They’re stacked with cash, ready to make moves that’ll put smaller players in the rearview. Jacobs isn’t here to gamble; he’s here to grab the industry by the throat, and he’s got the war chest to do it.\n\nThe Kushner Factor – Like It or Not\nHere’s something juicy for the conspiracy theorists: Jared Kushner is on the board. Yeah, some of you might hate him, but this guy’s got connections up to his eyeballs. And those connections come with cash. His firm, Affinity Partners, dropped a fat $150 million into QXO. Don’t like it? Too bad. Kushner’s network isn’t here to make friends; it’s here to get things done, open doors, and give QXO a reach into corners you don’t even know exist.\n\nWhen you’re trying to flip a trillion-dollar market on its head, having someone with global influence doesn’t hurt. Kushner might not be your buddy, but trust me, he’s good for business.\n\nJacobs’ Legacy: The Guy Knows How to Print Money\nListen up, because this isn’t some snake oil show. Jacobs’ track record is rock solid. This guy has pulled off business miracles before, and he doesn’t deal in hype—he deals in results. When he took on XPO, he didn’t just win; he redefined the game. XPO is now a giant, and Jacobs is ready to do the same with QXO.\n\nSo, if you’re waiting for him to stumble, keep waiting. Jacobs’ whole career has been about taking scrappy underdogs and turning them into business beasts. Now he’s taking everything he knows and throwing it into QXO. If you can’t see the potential, maybe stick to meme stocks.\n\nThe Stock Split Debacle – Here’s What Actually Happened\nAh, the infamous 1-for-8 reverse split. Yeah, that was a bit of a ride, but let me break it down for you: this wasn’t some sneaky “oh no, we’re failing” move. This was QXO setting itself up to be taken seriously by institutional investors. The split pushed the price up, making QXO look less like a penny stock and more like a heavyweight. But some of you lost your minds when it hit $235 on June 10th and the market cap skyrocketed to $90 billion. Did QXO magically become worth as much as Amazon overnight? No, don’t be dumb.\n\nHere’s what went down: because of the share structure change, there were way fewer shares out there for the taking. The supply got tighter than a drum, so naturally, the price shot up, and platforms didn’t adjust fast enough. It was a hiccup. The market cap was basically a mirage, not a problem with the company. If you panicked, that’s on you, not QXO.\n\nSince then, it’s settled down to a more reasonable $15.25 as of today. This isn’t volatility due to bad business. It’s due to mechanics. QXO still has the same cash pile, no debt, and Jacobs at the helm. If you got weak knees over a glitch in the system, you’re not cut out for this play.\n\nQXO’s Under the Radar – and Underpriced\nHere’s the deal: the market’s napping on QXO. Despite the players on board, this stock is still low-key. People are too busy betting on whatever’s hyped that day. But if you can look past the nonsense, this is one of the most undervalued plays you’ll find. Don’t believe me? Look at Trump’s election. QXO didn’t budge. No hype, no pump—it’s steady because it’s built for the long haul.\n\nThis isn’t a meme stock. It’s not chasing clout. It’s positioning for a colossal win that takes years, not days. If you don’t have the patience, keep walking.\n\nFor the Diamond Hands Only\nIf you’re here for a 3-day flip, leave now. QXO isn’t for the paper-handed. This is a stock for people who see the big picture, who understand that building value takes time. Brad Jacobs has done it before, and he’s doing it again. You want in? Then you’re here for the ride, no whining allowed. In a few years, QXO will be leading in building products, and the weak hands will be nowhere to be found.\n\nSo keep chasing those meme plays if that’s your thing, but for the real players—the ones who see Jacobs’ vision—QXO is one of the few long-term buys that could actually make you rich.\n\nPos - 2200 shares at $13.59 DCA \n\n*Disclaimer: Not financial advice.

With Apple Intelligence and general trend in tech stocks with AI boost, I still saw some upside and was thinking of holding for longer. But now what Trump won and tariffs are coming, I see Apple products becoming more expensive and taking a hit in sales in the US. \n\nAlso, I feel Elon has had a tiff with Apple in the past with them pulling ads from Twitter/X, Elon trying to launch Tesla Phone and some history with Apple refusing to buy Tesla since Elon had put some shitty condition like he wants to be CEO of Apple as part of the deal.\n\nDo you think Apple will likely see more downside with this Administration or will it likely be more or less the same fate as rest of the Tech stocks? Is Trump Victory ultimately agnostic to Apple's future?",
