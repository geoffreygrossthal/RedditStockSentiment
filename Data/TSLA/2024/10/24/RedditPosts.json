        "content": "Tesla shares soared 22% to close at $260.48 on Thursday, the stock’s best day since 2013, following the company’s better-than-expected earnings report.\n\nThe company late Wednesday reported revenue of $25.18 billion, which came in just under analysts’ expectations of $25.37 billion, but was up 8% compared with a year earlier. Tesla reported earnings per share of 72 cents adjusted, topping the average analyst estimate of 58 cents.\n\n“We expect this surprising earnings beat to power a strong positive reaction in Tesla shares Thursday, given the degree to which investors have become conditioned to earnings misses from the company,” analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a note.\n\nTesla’s profit margins in the third quarter were boosted by $739 million in revenue for environmental regulatory credits, which the JPMorgan analysts noted were a “potentially unsustainable driver” of earnings and cash flow.\n\nAutomakers are required to obtain a certain amount of regulatory credits every year, and if they can’t meet the target, they can buy credits from other companies. Tesla has excess credits because it only makes electric vehicles.\n\nTesla earnings also got a boost from FSD, the company’s Full Self-Driving Supervised system. CFO Vaibhav Taneja said on the earnings call that FSD contributed $326 million in revenue in the quarter after Tesla made it available for use in the Cybertruck and added a feature called “Actually Smart Summon.”\n\nCEO Elon Musk said on the call that his “best guess” is that “vehicle growth” will reach 20% to 30% next year, citing “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.” Analysts surveyed by FactSet were expecting delivery growth of about 15% for 2025.\n\nEven bullish Deutsche Bank analysts doubted Musk’s forecast and wrote, in a note following the earnings report, “Our view remains more reserved at 10-15% (~2.03m),” and assumes Tesla can roll out a cheaper version of its Model Y at a price under $30,000 after subsidies, and other variants of the small SUV.\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley who also recommend buying the stock, called Musk’s 2025 vehicle delivery growth prediction a “maybe.” They set their estimate at 14%.\n\nIt “clearly depends on the company’s ability to improve affordability through cheaper model (next gen) introduction, financing offers and improved features,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note Thursday.\n\nA grain of salt\n\nMusk said on the Wednesday call that Tesla plans to start production of its recently unveiled Cybercab, a robotaxi with butterfly doors and no steering wheel or pedals, by the end of 2026. He also said Tesla would conduct driverless ridehailing in California and Texas next year in its existing cars, which are not currently safe to use without a human driver ready to steer or brake at any time.\n\nBernstein analysts, who have a bearish price target of $120 on shares of Tesla, wrote in a note out Thursday: “The tone of Tesla’s conference call was ebullient and filled with Musk prognostications that have historically polarized bull and bear investors, and was more akin to a pep rally, with the company only taking two questions from sell-siders.”\n\nMusk has for years promised shareholders a software upgrade that can turn Teslas into robotaxis. That hasn’t happened yet. Musk has also promised a refreshed version of the Tesla Roadster since 2017. The design of the vehicle is not yet complete. \n\nThe Bernstein analysts wrote, “We continue to struggle to see Tesla overcoming the technological and regulatory hurdles needed to leapfrog current level 4 robotaxis, and believe fully unsupervised FSD could be years away.”\n\nThey pointed to Musk’s “long history of being overly optimistic about FSD” and said crowdsourced research that shows “Tesla continues to lag well behind competitors” on robotaxis.\n\nThe share rally Thursday was the sharpest since a 24% gain in May 2013. The jump erased Tesla’s loss for the year and left the stock up 3% in 2024, though it still trails the 22% gain for the Nasdaq.\n\nSource: https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/24/tesla-shares-surge-as-analysts-react-to-q3-earnings-musk-predictions.html",

        "content": "SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's SK Hynix on Thursday posted a record quarterly profit as the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) supplier saw strong sales of its advanced chips such as high bandwidth memory (HBM) ones used in generative AI chipsets.\n\nThe world's second-biggest memory chipmaker reported a 7 trillion won ($5.07 billion) operating profit for the July-September quarter versus a 1.8 trillion won loss a year earlier.\n\nThat compared with a 6.8 trillion won average forecast by LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward analysts who are more consistently accurate.\n\nSK Hynix has outperformed rivals Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) in recent quarters, as it has benefited the most from AI-driven appetite for high-end memory chips following its early entry and large investments in HBM chip development.\n\n\"HBM sales showed excellent growth, up more than 70% from the previous quarter and more than 330% from the same period last year,\" SK Hynix said in a statement.\n\nSK Hynix sees HBM sales making up 40% of its total DRAM revenue in the fourth quarter, up from 30% in the third quarter, and added it expects memory chip demand for AI servers to grow further next year as global tech companies continue developing generative AI.\n\nRevenue for the quarter rose 94% year-on-year to 17.6 trillion won.\n\nSK Hynix shares have jumped 38.5% so far this year, outperforming Samsung, whose stocks has slumped 24.7% over the same period.\n\nLast month, SK Hynix, the main supplier of HBM chips to Nvidia, said it had started mass production of HBM3E 12-layer chips and plans to supply the latest products to unidentified customers by the end of this year.",

        "content": "Badluck\n\n1. This past November, the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems, or UAMPS, terminated what was to be “the first NuScale Power small modular reactor plant to begin operation in the United States.” This was a death foretold; the red flags have been obvious for years now.\n\nhttps://www.utilitydive.com/news/nuscale-uamps-project-small-modular-reactor-ramanasmr-/705717/\n\n2. NuScale also didn't make the final cut to build SMR in the UK\n\n>US company eliminated from race to build Britain’s first mini-nuclear plant\n\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2024/09/25/us-firm-eliminated-from-race-build-britain-first-mini-nuke/\n\nThe naysayers are stating due to unproven technology, nobody wants to be the 1st guinea pig.  It is costly upfront and if something goes wrong they might be on hook in fines and penalties (hazardous material handling).\n\nBut this said... recently, the Biden admin has greenlit financial assistance approval for nuclear energy related projects.  \n\nChina and Russia already have approved SMRs and I believe they have a few already up and running.  \n\nThe unfairness is that - their gov't can absorb the costs if something goes wrong. \n\nQuestions\n\n1. Why doesn't the US gov't go a little deeper into the projects and bear some of the costs/potential dangers associated with it? \n\n2. Big companies like Amazon and Google have signed up partnerships with energy companies for SMR to be designed/built.  Why don't they just partner with a company like NuScale instead (approved SMR design)?\n\nAt the end of day, in 10 years... if energy infrastructure stays the way it is - the US could be way behind Russia/China in terms of energy source/efficienct. Nevermind inability to power many data centers etc. and not ability to meet its clean energy goals. \n\nThoughts?\n",
