        "content": "I just hit 100k in my portfolio with 52% in SP500 (all VOO) and now interested in switching to go heavier in dividend stocks. My portfolios other holdings are “safe” TSLA, AMZN, MSFT, AAPL…The two dividend stocks I’m holding are monthly paid dividend all reinvested, (SCM, GLAD) earning me $20 and change a month each and have not lost capital. For some reason my mind is telling me to open a new brokerage account dedicated to only dividend and let my 100k sit dormant, is there any upside to this or is the same as putting money in my current account just reallocate the automatic funds from going to VOO into the dividend stocks. Still kind of hesitant to stop investing in the SP all together. I have a ROTH that is maxed out every year and contribute 6% to my 401k with a 4% company match. No real-estate owned, sheets expensive out there.",
