        "content": "'Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) will employ 75,000 logistics and fulfillment workers in North America at an average starting wage of $17 an hour.\n\nMost of the hires will be placed at the company fulfillment locations and network of local delivery centers after positioning its final-mile delivery network at the closest range of the end customers.\n\nAmazon has 409 delivery stations in the U.S., out of which 344 support package deliveries and the rest support heavy, bulky items that are typically non-conveyable.\n\nAmazon plans to build 229 additional delivery stations, out of which 193 are meant for packages. Amazon has 16 delivery stations in Canada, with seven more on the drawing board.\n\nAmazon will offer several new employees a $1,000 signing bonus and an additional $100 to the vaccinated ones. Amazon offers on-site vaccinations at over 250 locations in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nIn April, Amazon announced an investment of over $1 billion for a wage hike of over 500,000 hourly employees by between 50 cents and $3 an hour.\n\nLast year Amazon added over 500,000 workers globally, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nThe hiring comes just before the annual Prime Day shopping event, which was preponed from July to June.\n\nAmazon continues to face employee flak for difficult work conditions in their warehouses including Alabama, and Chicago. The company has refuted the allegations and assured necessary efforts for improved working conditions.'\n\nSource:  https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/05/21108100/amazon-to-hire-75k-workers-for-north-american-logistics-fulfillment",
