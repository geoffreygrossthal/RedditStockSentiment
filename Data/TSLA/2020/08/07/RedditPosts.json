        "content": "Critics argue that stock splits are non-events, that splitting a $400 stock 4:1 results in 4 shares trading at $100 each. Research shows splits add value. An Aug 2003 study at the Univ Illinois found that stocks that split beat the market by 8% in Yr 1, and by 12% in Yr 3. \n\nWhy do stock splits work?\n- Draws attention to the stock’s past success (momentum)\n- Tend to be followed by increased earnings and dividends (signaling)\n- Attracts new investors who couldn’t afford (broadens base)\n\nI continue to buy AAPL in front of its 4:1 split on August 31, up to $480.",
