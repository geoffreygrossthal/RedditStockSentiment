        "content": "[The US bank JPMorgan has raised its price target for Tesla from USD 275 to USD 295 following deliveries in the second quarter, but has left the rating at “Underweight”. These were better than expected, analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a study available on Monday. In addition, media reports suggested that the manufacturer of electric vehicles may have been profitable in the second quarter as well. However, Brinkman maintained that the valuation of the share was clearly too high.](https://gryffintrading.com/2020/07/06/tesla-stock-defies-pessimistic-analysts-and-rises-to-ever-new-heights/)\n\nMeanwhile TSLA is trading at 1,2k. I dont even know how this is possible, either the analysts valuations are entirely unrealistic or this is an insane bubble. In reality, the analysts are probably dumb and TSLA is also overvalued.",
