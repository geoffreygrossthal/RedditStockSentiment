        "content": "The podcast gets 200M+ listens a month, and that doesn’t even count YouTube views on clips/full episodes. Spotify is going to see a huge boost in users, have to assume some will enjoy the app and be interested in having their podcasts/music in the same place. Currently trading @ 176.45. How big of an impact can it have? I think it could be huge, I’ll be downloading it again even though I have Apple Music.\n\nUPDATE: It closed @ 174.90 from day traders capitalizing on the news. Still up 8% on the day though. Buy the dip?\n\n\nAnother Note since there’s confusion below: You do not have to have Spotify premium to listen, you just need an account, and you can listen for free. However, having Premium will remove all advertisements, which are usually very lengthy on his show. Also: Joe says he still has 100% creative control, it is a licensing agreement. He is not censored in any way.",
