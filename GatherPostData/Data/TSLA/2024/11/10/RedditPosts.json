The report was impressively detailed, but the market shrugged it off. \n\nCan this be due to popularity? \n\nI‚Äôm not sure of everyone else, but I‚Äôm not very familiar with the name. It‚Äôs in my opinion that if Hindenburg were to have done the short report, there would have been legitimate consequences on the stock price. \n\nAnyways that‚Äôs beside the point. Carvana and its management continue to reap the benefits, selling their holdings.\n\nThere‚Äôs something going on underneath the hood. \n\nCarvana is a subprime predator lender and booking their only profits with the help of drivetime. Cars are being booked for well under their cost and loans are being sold for well above market value over to drive time, even though the 10k reports nothing of the sort. \n\nPerhaps because drivetime is a private company they can secretly fund this incredible growth.\n\nNate at hindenburg said that the Co is a ‚Äúknown‚Äùproblem on X, but I would like their to be a thorough analysis.\n\nThat also brings into question do the popular Activist short seller funds touch each others research finds?

Imagine this: you‚Äôre leaning back in your Tesla, feet out the window, bumping Larry June, letting the self-driving magic take over. And that‚Äôs not a daydream ‚Äì it‚Äôs a future Elon is actually building.\n\nThe DD:\n\n\t1.\tFull Self-Driving (FSD) is coming in hot üî•\nElon recently hinted that we‚Äôre getting closer to full self-driving approval, and as you all know, the second that happens, TSLA‚Äôs value proposition changes. Imagine: no more steering wheels, no more gas pedals, just feet-out-the-window vibes and profit. When that drops, so do our tendies from the sky. And it‚Äôs not just hype; it‚Äôs pushing the envelope and likely to get the regulators on board eventually.\n\t2.\tThe Larry June Effect üçä\nReal ones know that when you‚Äôre listening to Larry June, you‚Äôre already winning. And Tesla gets this vibe. It‚Äôs the only brand that could be synonymous with chilling in your car while it drives itself. Apple ain‚Äôt got that juice, GM ain‚Äôt got it, and Rivian‚Äôs still stuck in the mud. Elon‚Äôs got the cool factor, and I think they‚Äôre going to capitalize on it in ways we can‚Äôt even imagine.\n\t3.\tMassive Upside, Minimal Risk (kinda) üìà\nTesla‚Äôs stock has been steady but is starting to look a little too chill. Volatility is about to spike when self-driving makes headlines. Wall Street doesn‚Äôt get the culture shift this brings. But we do. While they‚Äôre all holding off, we‚Äôre grabbing 0DTE $TSLA calls like legends.\n\t4.\tEarnings Are Coming Up üí∞\nWe‚Äôre talking revenue boosts from FSD subscriptions, increased production, and probably some other crazy metric Elon will throw out there to pump the stock. If there‚Äôs a time to bet on TSLA, it‚Äôs now.\n\nThe Play:\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tStrike: Go with something just OTM for max risk/reward ratio.\n\t‚Ä¢\tExpirations: If you have the iron guts, grab some 0DTEs. If you want to hedge a bit, get some for next month as well.\n\nTo the moon, with my feet out the window and Larry June on repeat. Let‚Äôs ride this self-driving rocket into the next stratosphere. üçä\n\n",
